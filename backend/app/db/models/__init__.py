"""Models.

Some of these tables are lookup tables, i.e. the ones which have a DocumentXXX counterpart.

Values for these lookups can be found here:
https://www.notion.so/climatepolicyradar/External-Pre-Existing-Classifications-0409cd1a01d44362b48b34c24d10cd4c

However, for now we write the values into the lookups as they come from the uploader.
As more sources come online, we'll set up a mapping between the source's term, and our term
(the latter which is currently based on CCLW).


These lookups are global:
- language
- geography
- source
- category
- framework
- hazard
- response (named 'topic' outside the app)

These lookups are source-specific:
- instrument
- sector
