Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

This\nfigure represents a 52.2% increase with respect to base year emissions, or almost 37.2\npercentual excess points over the commitment under the Kyoto Protocol. The year\n2005 was characterized by low hidraulicity, an abnormally low contribution of nuclear\npower and a high price of natural gas, but also by the beginning of a change in primary\nenergy demand growth rate trend. While the official data of 2006 GHG emissions is\nmade available, the information about the energy sector (electricity and fuels,\nessentially) allows to estimate a significant inflexion point in the growth model of the\nSpanish economy. Next to a GDP growth of 3.9% , the demand for primary energy fell\nby 1.3% with respect to the previous year, which can represent a significant reduction\nin GHG

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

Sustainable Development Strategy (EEDS). The EECCEL includes different measures that contribute to sustainable development within the scope of climate change and clean energy.  This Strategy is based on the reference framework of the 'Spanish Strategy for the fulfilment of the objectives under the Kyoto Protocol', and it takes into account the measures and Programmes adopted by the Autonomous Communities.  The strategy has two chapters. The first one defines actions to fight against climate change and the second one, actions to achieve cleaner energy. Each chapter includes a description of the present situation, the objectives to be reached, the suggested measures and a selection of indicators for the corresponding follow-up.  The operational objectives are: - To ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in Spain, giving special importance to measures related to the energy sector. According to the national inventory, in 2005, emissions from energy process represented about 78.87% of total national emissions. - To contribute to sustainable development and the fulfilment of climate change commitments by strengthening the use of flexible project-based mechanisms. - To promote additional reduction measures in sectors concerned with diffuse pollution. - To apply the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) so as to integrate adaptation measures and strategies in sectoral policies. - To increase public awareness with respect to clean energy and climate change. - To promote research, development and innovation in matters of climate change and clean energy. - To guarantee energy supply security by means of cleaner energies, mainly from renewable sources, achieving other environmental benefits (for example, air quality) and limiting the growth rate of external energy dependence. - To boost energy- and resource efficiency for companies and for end users.  The government has adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures (PMU), which together with the 2008-2012 Energy Saving and Efficiency Action Plan aims to consolidate the trend change of GHG emissions in Spain initiated in 2006.","document_source_url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1674%20English.pdf","document_cdn_object":"ESP/2007/spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93.pdf","document_md5_sum":"2b072ba79a80c48468424f57a5937e93","translated":false,"document_slug":"spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2007","document_geography":"ESP","document_category":"Policy","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Strategy","document_sectors":["Energy"],"document_name_and_slug":"Spanish Climate Change And Clean Energy Strategy Horizon 2007- 2012 -2020 spain_2007_spanish-climate-change-and-clean-energy-strategy-horizon-2007-2012-2020_1674_3157"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme.

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme.

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme.

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme.

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme.

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits","document_description":"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.","document_source_url":"https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c465bbadbc173d88ce267d8db9943fb62194160b/f","document_cdn_object":"KOR/2012/act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9.pdf","document_md5_sum":"bb567c0dfbbbaa960a8b017adf399ee9","translated":false,"document_slug":"south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254","document_content_type":"application/pdf","document_date":"01/01/2012","document_geography":"KOR","document_category":"Law","document_source":"CCLW","document_type":"Act","document_sectors":["Energy","Industry","Residential and Commercial","Transportation"],"document_name_and_slug":"Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits south-korea_2012_act-on-the-allocation-and-trading-of-greenhouse-gas-emission-permits_1647_2254"}}

Despite those achievements, unsus-\ntainable trends still persist in the four priority areas\nidentified in the 6th EAP: climate change; nature and\nbiodiversity, environment and health and quality of life:\nand natural resources and wastes.\nThe final assessment of the 6th EAP highlighted some\nshortcomings. The achievement of the objectives set\nout in the Seventh Environment Action Programme\n(7th EAP) therefore requires the full commitment of\nthe Member States and the relevant Union institutions\nand the willingness to take responsibility for the\ndelivery of the programme's intended benefits.\nAccording to the report of the European Environment\nAgency entitled The European environment - state and\noutlook 2010' (SOER 2010) a number of major envi-\nronmental challenges still remain, and serious reper-\ncussions will ensue if nothing is done to address them.\nGlobal systemic trends and challenges, related to popu\nlation dynamics, urbanisation, disease and pandemics,\naccelerating technological change and unsustainable\neconomic growth add to the complexity of tackling envi-\nronmental challenges and achieving long-term sustainable\ndevelopment.
