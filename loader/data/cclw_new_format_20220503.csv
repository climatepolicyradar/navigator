The first NEEAP outlined the existing planned energy efficiency measures to decrease the energy consumption by 1% annually during the nine years between 2008 and 2016. The objectives of the NEEAP I are as follows: alignment of Hungary's energy policy initiatives with those of the EU; finding the most cost-effective solutions for utilization of energy-saving potential; shaping consumer awareness and influencing the market in order to achieve long-term energy efficiency; informing market players of the structure and time frame of the plans; realization of the EU's energy efficiency expectations of member states; and consideration of climate protection aspects. According to the NEEAP and the Governmental decree No.64 of 2009, the Ministry of National Development (former Ministry of Transport, Telecommunication and Energy) is responsible for the preparation of NEEAPs. Co-ordination of the implementation of NEEAP and the verification of its progress falls under the responsibility of the Energy Centre, a government-owned energy efficiency, environment and energy information agency non-profit company. It is the national agency responsible for energy efficiency and renewable energy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Plan also notes that actions including the following could further save energy:extension of state aid to upgrade household appliances and lightbulbs; state aid to develop energy saving awareness activities; making the use of energy efficient office equipment obligatory; promotion of the dissemination of energy-saving building technologies; and strengthening the energy aspect of environmental and traffic safety considerations in connection with the import of used vehicles.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The NEEAP was modified in 2010 under the Governmental Decision No.1076 of 2010 on the Modified National Energy Efficiency Action Plan of Hungary (MNEEAP) and the second NEEAP (NEEAP II) was adopted under the Governmental Decision No.1374 of 2011. The NEEAP II includes shortcomings and an action plan aiming to solve them, national energy saving targets and measures in energy end-use, sectoral measures for energy saving and institutions responsible for implementation and monitoring. Identified shortcomings includes the lack of following: overarching, nationwide demand forecast based on reliable fuel and electricity demand forecast; sufficient monitoring of implementation of the measures in NEEAP I; reliable information on opportunities for energy savings in industry; energy data of dwelling houses; and reliable data about the energy consumption of public buildings."

While the overall direction of the document is development of the country, climate change is considered as one of the challenges the country would face that requires mitigation and adaptation. Pakistan's vulnerabilities are seen as an important challenge of its transition towards a high level of sustained growth. Following vulnerabilities and challenges are mentioned in the document:<br />
- Water security: current water availability is less than 1,100 cubic meters per person, down from 5,000 cubic meters in 1951; Pakistan's water storage capacity is limited to 30 days<br />
- Food security: Pakistan ranks 76th of the 107 countries on the Global Food Security Index<br />
- Glacial melt: Indus basin (water reservoir) affected by the glaciers in the Hindukush-Karakoram and Himalayas<br />
- Biodiversity threat caused by climate change: habitat destruction and alteration, biotechnology (such as basmati rice, turmeric and neem) and threats of genetically modified seeds and germplasm to indigenous species<br />
- Energy security: alternative energy<br />
- Institutions that favour the status quo<br />
- Infrastructure bottleneck.<br />
<br />
The Vision 2025 stands upon the target fulfilment of the MDGs and SDGs by 2030. The document also sets out 25 goals in accordance to the 7 pillars. The goals that are related to the purpose of this study are as follows:<br />
- Double power generation to over 45,000MW, to provide uninterrupted and affordable electricity<br />
- Increase access to electricity from 67% to 90% of the population<br />

<br />
The government approved in April 2014 an Action Plan to achieve the GHG emissions reduction goal that consists of three parts:<br />
- Development of GHG emissions accounting and reporting system at regional and private corporate level;<br />
- Development of GHG emissions scenarios for the period up to 2020 and towards 2030 (including GHG emissions reduction potential by economy sectors);<br />
- Provisions for future development of measures for carbon regulation. As the action plan remains a framework document, it does not identify specific types of regulation but rather calls for elaboration of long-term scenarios and a concept for carbon-regulation to be completed during 2015 (aimed at providing incentives and support for GHG emissions reduction projects)."

It seeks to transform Rwanda into a middle-income country by the year 2020. This will require achieving annual per capita income of USD900 (USD290 today), a poverty rate of 30% (64% today) and an average life expectance of 55 years (49 years today).<br />
<br />
The framework includes the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure as a crucial aspect in lowering the costs of doing business. It calls for: (i) a modern land law providing security of tenure and freedom of exchange; (ii) the development of alternative lower costs of transport to the sea; and (iii) increase of energy production and diversification into alternative energy sources. Rwanda has considerable hydroelectric potential, in addition to large deposits of renewable methane gas in Lake Kivu, estimated at 60bn m3. In rural areas direct solar energy or photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155m tons of peat deposit is currently exploitable. Rwanda projects that by 2020, at least 35% of the population will be connected to electricity (up from the current 6%).<br />
<br />
Vision 2020 recognises sustainable environmental and climate change management as a cross-cutting pivotal area to the realisation of national aspirations. It recognises that the major problem in environmental protection is the imbalance between the population and the natural resources. This leads to alarming degradation observed through massive deforestation, the depletion of biodiversity, erosion and landslides, pollution of waterways and the degradation of fragile ecosystems.<br />
<br />
To protect the environment against massive deforestation and soil destruction, Vision 2020 sets the target for the protection rate against erosion to rise from 20% in 2000 to 90% by year 2020. To ease the pressure on wood biomass seeing that 86.3% of the Rwandan population uses wood as the source of energy, Vision 2020 targets to drop the use of wood energy in national energy balance, to 50% by 2020 through diversification of energy sources availed to the population."

All self-consumers connected to the grid (see below) have to be registered with the Registry for Electrical Energy Self-Consumption, even if they do not ever intend on selling any surplus energy that they generate to the grid (isolated facilities exempt).<br />
There are two self-consumption modalities:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>'supply with self-consumption' - consumer with a contracted power of maximum 100 kW, owning at least one generation facility within its internal network, not registered as production facility</li><br />
<li>'production with self-consumption' - consumer associated to at least one generation facility connected within its network; the total power of the production facilities must be lower or equal to the consumer contracted power</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Decree allows for electricity storage devices installed within the self-consumption facilities, but makes them financially unattractive.<br />
All self-consumers have to pay 'access tolls' to the grid to contribute to its maintenance and operations. Tolls depend on the real use of the grid (contracted power and energy introduced in the border point). Under the second modality, 'access tolls' for feeding energy to the network are to be paid. In addition, all self-consumers have to pay the ""charges associated to the electricity system cost"", as well as the 'charge for other services of the system' (i.e. back-up of the self-consumer's facilities provided by the electrical system; can vary or be exempt for non-mainland territories and low voltage consumers - under 10 kW). Some existing facilities (e.g. cogeneration, small generation of <50 MW) are temporarily exempt from the charges until 31 December 2019.<br />
Both types of self-consumers can purchase additional electricity. However, only facilities registered under the second modality are entitled to receive a financial compensation for providing electricity to the grid. This prohibits individual small self-consumers from receiving compensation for any self-generated and unused electricity, unless they register as electricity production businesses."

The first NEEAP outlined the existing planned energy efficiency measures to decrease the energy consumption by 1% annually during the nine years between 2008 and 2016. The objectives of the NEEAP I are as follows: alignment of Hungary's energy policy initiatives with those of the EU; finding the most cost-effective solutions for utilization of energy-saving potential; shaping consumer awareness and influencing the market in order to achieve long-term energy efficiency; informing market players of the structure and time frame of the plans; realization of the EU's energy efficiency expectations of member states; and consideration of climate protection aspects. According to the NEEAP and the Governmental decree No.64 of 2009, the Ministry of National Development (former Ministry of Transport, Telecommunication and Energy) is responsible for the preparation of NEEAPs. Co-ordination of the implementation of NEEAP and the verification of its progress falls under the responsibility of the Energy Centre, a government-owned energy efficiency, environment and energy information agency non-profit company. It is the national agency responsible for energy efficiency and renewable energy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Plan also notes that actions including the following could further save energy:extension of state aid to upgrade household appliances and lightbulbs; state aid to develop energy saving awareness activities; making the use of energy efficient office equipment obligatory; promotion of the dissemination of energy-saving building technologies; and strengthening the energy aspect of environmental and traffic safety considerations in connection with the import of used vehicles.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The NEEAP was modified in 2010 under the Governmental Decision No.1076 of 2010 on the Modified National Energy Efficiency Action Plan of Hungary (MNEEAP) and the second NEEAP (NEEAP II) was adopted under the Governmental Decision No.1374 of 2011. The NEEAP II includes shortcomings and an action plan aiming to solve them, national energy saving targets and measures in energy end-use, sectoral measures for energy saving and institutions responsible for implementation and monitoring. Identified shortcomings includes the lack of following: overarching, nationwide demand forecast based on reliable fuel and electricity demand forecast; sufficient monitoring of implementation of the measures in NEEAP I; reliable information on opportunities for energy savings in industry; energy data of dwelling houses; and reliable data about the energy consumption of public buildings."
