1385.0,National energy strategy: for a more competitive and sustainable energy,"The National Energy Strategy (NES), which has a double time horizon (2020 and 2050), directs efforts towards substantially improving the competitiveness of the energy system and environmental sustainability. The results expected by 2020 are:1) Wholesale prices of all energy sources will be aligned with average European average price levels, resulting in savings of about EUR9bn (USD11.3bn)/year in the overall power and gas bill (from current EUR70bn (USD87.8bn) - assuming same commodity prices).2) Expenditure on energy imports will be reduced by about EUR14bn (USD17.6bn)/year from the present EUR62bn (USD77.8bn), and dependency on foreign supplies from 84% to 67%, thanks to energy efficiency, increased production from renewables, lower electricity imports and increased production from national resources. 3) Private investment of EUR180bn (USD213bn) will be supported by incentives between now and 2020 in renewables and energy efficiency and in traditional sectors (electricity and gas networks, re-gasification plants, storage, hydrocarbon development).4) GHG emissions will fall by about 21% compared to the 2005 level, exceeding the European 20-20-20 targets for Italy.5) Renewable energy sources will account for 19-20% of gross final consumption (compared with about 10% in 2010). This is equivalent to 22-23% of primary energy consumption, while fossil fuel use will fall from 86% to 76%. Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).6) Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures. To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:1) Fostering Energy Efficiency2) Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices3) Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\20-20-20\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive4) Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production5) Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level6) Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection7) Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient8) Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:1) The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical2) The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure3) A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport4) The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario",ITA,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaE1HIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--76ef762e995acedaa724541f478f6b4d776afd78/f|it,executive,08/03/2013|Law passed||;25/12/2017|Approved||,Energy;Industry;Residential and Commercial;Transportation,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",,Mitigation,,Strategy,2013,Italian,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand,,

The objectives of the Policy Framework are: To mainstream climate change considerations into national policies and development planning and to build the country's capacity to implement climate change adaptation and mitigation activities.To support the institutions responsible for research, monitoring and projections on climate change, to facilitate decision-making and strategic actions at all levels.To facilitate and coordinate the national response to the impacts of climate change and promote low carbon development.To improve communication at all levels on climate change impacts and also adaptation and mitigation related opportunities.To mobilize climate financing for adaptation and mitigation initiatives.To encourage the private sector to embrace climate change imperatives and promote the development and implementation of technologies and processes that contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives.  On the basis of this Policy Framework, relevant sectors are to develop or update individual plans addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation, taking into account the following principles: Sustainable use of natural resourcesMulti-sectoral approach to climate changePublic participation and collaborationThe Precautionary ApproachTransparency and accountabilityBest sciencePolluter Pays PrincipleInter- and intra-generational equity The Policy Framework also provides for specific strategies, legislation and policies to be adopted and implemented, including: Enactment of framework for climate change mitigation and adaptation;Development of a Climate Financing Strategy;Development of Research, Technology, Training and Knowledge Management;Regional and International Engagement and Participation;Promotion of Consultative Processes and Communication to Improve Public Participation in Mitigation and Adaptation Response Measures;Strengthening Climate Change Governance Arrangements;Development and incorporation of mechanisms and tools to mainstream climate change into ecosystem protection and land-use and physical planning The implementation of the Framework is to be overseen and supported by the Ministry of Water, Land, Environment and Climate Change (MWLECC). In the short-term, the Climate Change Division (CCD) within the MWLECC, has the administrative oversight and responsibility for climate change initiatives. In the medium term, a Climate Change Department is to be established. A Climate Change Focal Point Network is also to be established, composed of focal points appointed in all ministries, selected departments and agencies, and representatives of civil society and private groups. The MWLECC is to present to Cabinet an annual report on measures that have been undertaken to implement this Policy Framework and, after five years, the Policy Framework should be publicly reviewed. The Policy Framework also identifies a number of Special Initiatives for early implementation: Special Initiative for Water Resources ManagementSpecial Initiative for Low Carbon DevelopmentSpecial Initiative for Disaster Risk FinancingSpecial Initiative for Ecosystem ProtectionSpecial Initiative for Land Use PlanningSpecial Initiative for Communication",JAM,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbjhNIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--1948ac272e274ab45b8c956916f5b9c56c30b8b6/Jamaica-Climate-Change-Policy-fwL-2015.pdf|en,executive,01/09/2015|Law passed||,Economy-wide;Social development;Transportation,"Capacity building|Governance;Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;International cooperation|Governance;Education, training and knowledge dissemination|Information",Adaptation;Mitigation,Adaptation,,Framework,2015,English,Adaptation;Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Redd+ And Lulucf,,

The Act elaborates the responsibilities of the Ministry of Energy for renewables, which include the development of a national strategy of research in this field and creation of an Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), to be in charge the production, distribution, supply and use of renewable energy.

The Energy Management regulations of 2012 establishes that a commission shall carry out energy consumption rating for all facilities, mandates owner occupier of large facilities to appoint an energy officer and develop an energy management policy that outlines measures of efficiency and conservation, mandates submission of energy audit reports, develop an energy investment plan and demonstrate its implementation in a phased manner.

The Energy (Solar Water Heating) Regulations 2012 were made under section 110 of the Energy Act, 2006. They require all premises with hot water requirements exceeding 100 litres/day to install and use solar heating systems. Violation of the provisions can result in fines (up to 1 million shillings) or imprisonment (up to 1 year) or both.

By identifying tangible, on-the-ground actions for resilience and measures that enable the Government to facilitate these, the plan will guide the implementation of these complementary policies in an integrated approach. The government hopes that such a systematic approach will maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of existing capacities and resources as well as ensuring the success of new initiatives. The specific goals of the policy are: 1) strengthening good governance, policies, strategies and legislation, 2) improving knowledge and information generation, management and sharing, 3) strengthening and greening the private sector, including small-scale business, 4) increasing water and food security with integrated and sector-specific approaches and promoting healthy and resilient ecosystems, 5) strengthening health service delivery to address climate change impacts, 6) promoting sound and reliable infrastructure development and land management, 7) delivering appropriate education, training and awareness programs, 8) increasing effectiveness and efficiency of early warnings and disaster and emergency management, 9) promoting the use of sustainable, renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency, 10) strengthening capacity to access finance, monitor expenditures and maintain strong partnerships, 11) maintaining the existing sovereignty and unique identity of Kiribati, and 12) enhancing the participation and resilience of vulnerable groups. The document further examines administrative and governance factors, as well as financial resources needed for implementing such an approach. ",KIR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBc2tNIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--11c3efb7f290627c67fd2bd9a9ff8377acbf03cf/2019%20Kiribati-Joint-Implementation-Plan-for-Climate-Change-and-Disaster-Risk-Management-2019-2028.pdf|en,executive,25/12/2014|Law passed||;01/01/2019|Approved||,Energy;Health;LULUCF;Transportation;Water,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",Adaptation;Drm/Drr,Adaptation;Disaster Risk Management;Loss And Damage,Cyclones;Tsunamis;Storms;Hurricanes;Soil Erosion;Sea Level Rise,Plan,2019,English,Adaptation;Energy Supply;Energy Demand,,
8869.0,National Water Resources Policy,"Kiribati's National Water Resources Policy and Implementation Plan deals first and foremost with the impacts of climate change on water supply. It outlines three concrete policy goals, as well as seven, more specific policy objectives.

The goals are to (1) provide safe, socially equitable, financially, technically and environmentally sustainable water supplies to enhance the welfare and livelihood of I-Kiribati, (2) Protect and conserve freshwater sources for public water supplies, and (3) Deliver freshwater efficiently and effectively.

The objectives are to (1) increase access to safe and reliable water supplies, (2) achieve sustainable water resource management, (3) improve understanding and monitoring of water resources and their use, (4) improve protection of public freshwater sources, (5) increase community awareness of and participation in the protection, management and conservation of water, (6) improve governance in the water sector, and (7) decrease unaccounted for water losses, improve cost recovery and find alternate sources of water.

The policy places special emphasis on climate change in sustainable water use management. It states that the government intends to sustainably manage water and sanitation services ""during climatic extremes,"" such as droughts, heavy rains, and storm surges, all of which can decrease quality and quantity of water supply.

The implementation plan defines the priority actions and sector-specific strategies for implementing the policy. Importantly, it also assigns those actions to specific actors in government.",KIR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcWdGIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--8d01c59770e4d8cd2567ffd9bbd63a766f7680ff/f|,executive,01/11/2008|Law passed,Health;Water,,,Adaptation,,Policy,2008,English,Adaptation,,

General objectives are: reducing poverty to minimal levels; becoming a middle-income country; becoming a newly industrialised country; and consolidating democracy and enhancing national unity. It was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development.

Climate change is identified in Vision 2035 as one of the two major challenges to Cameroon's economy. Over exploitation of natural resources and environmental costs have been warned as it results in climate change threats; Cameroon is partly located in Sahel area with existing harmful effects of climate change: desert encroachment, increased temperatures, irregular seasons, sea level rise, floods, volcanism, landslides rock fall and toxic fumes. The document calls for reduction of greenhouse gases to tackle climate change as a key regional strategy for Cameroon. The Government of Cameroon pledges to seek high growth level while achieving Millennium Development Goals.

Under the tentative implementation schedule of Vision 2035, drafting and implementation of major environmental policy to fight against the climate change impact is planned for the phase one (2010-2019). Climate change control is listed as one of the three specific objectives for the phase two (2020-2027).

10087.0,The 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China and Outline of the Vision for 2035,"The 14th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2021-2025 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. Like previous five-year plans, the 14th Five Year plan sets out the direction of travel for China’s climate action over the period 2021 - 2025. It also contains references to the long-term direction of travel until 2035. The plan was released and ratified by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. The plan reiterates the previously announced target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and sets a goal of seeing emissions peak in 2030. The most critical provision in the plan concerning climate is Article XXVIII, which contains a section entitled ‘Actively respond to climate change”, but various other provisions also touch on climate issues.  Relevant provisions are summarised below: Article III: Main Goals Section 1 of Article 3 sets out China’s long-term goals until 2035. It includes an emphasis on “green modes of production” and notes that “carbon emissions will decline steadily after reaching a peak”. More detailed objectives are set out in Section 2, which reads: “Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5% and 18% respectively, total emissions of the main pollutants will continue to fall, and the rate of forest coverage will increase to 24.1%.

10087.0,Outline of the People's Republic of China 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives for 2035,"The 14th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2021-2025 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. Like previous five-year plans, the 14th Five Year plan sets out the direction of travel for China’s climate action over the period 2021 - 2025. It also contains references to the long-term direction of travel until 2035. The plan was released and ratified by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. The plan reiterates the previously announced target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and sets a goal of seeing emissions peak in 2030. The most critical provision in the plan concerning climate is Article XXVIII, which contains a section entitled ‘Actively respond to climate change”, but various other provisions also touch on climate issues.  Relevant provisions are summarised below: Article III: Main Goals Section 1 of Article 3 sets out China’s long-term goals until 2035. It includes an emphasis on “green modes of production” and notes that “carbon emissions will decline steadily after reaching a peak”. More detailed objectives are set out in Section 2, which reads: “Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5% and 18% respectively, total emissions of the main pollutants will continue to fall, and the rate of forest coverage will increase to 24.1%. The ecological environment will continue to improve, ecological safety barriers will be made more secure, and urban and rural living environments will be significantly improved.” Article IX: Develop and expand strategic emerging industries Article 9 emphasises the need to seize opportunities for ecosystem driven development and includes provisions on bioenergy.  Article XI Build a modern infrastructure system This article includes plans to develop low-carbon, clean energy, with a focus on wind, hydro and nuclear, referred to as a “modern energy system”.

10332.0,Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking before 2030,"This Action Plan aims to enable carbon dioxide peaking by 2030 and ultimately achieve carbon neutrality. It covers the 14th and 15th five-year plan periods. It seeks to strengthen the government's ability to mobilise the nation as a whole and involve the private sector into the decarbonisation efforts. It highlights 1) the promotion of innovation in green and low-carbon science and technology, 2) institutional reform in energy and other relevant fields, 3) the development of incentives and constraint mechanisms, and 4) the need to ""avoid excessive side effects"" of decarbonisation policies, so as to maintain energy security and economic development as the bottom line. The plan also calls for stimulating international cooperation, notably through 1) global climate governance, 2) green cooperation on business, technology, and finance, and 3) making Belt and Road Initiative green.The Action Plan further seeks to enhance policy support by developing  a unified and standardised carbon emissions measuring and counting system; improve laws, regulations and standards; optimise economic policies; and establish further market mechanisms. It should be implemented through a strengthening of planning and coordination efforts, ensuring that responsibilities are taken at all levels, and develop a strict oversight and assessment system.The document lists a series of sectoral policy goals which are as following.Energy demand and supply:Promote coal substitution as well as transformation and upgrading. The document mandates to ""strictly control the scale of supplementary coal power"" and of coal consumption growth.Develop wind, solar and hydropower according to local context.Develop nuclear power through a safe and orderly approach Rationally regulating oil and gas consumption. The plan notably promotes alternatives like advanced liquid biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, the use of liquid natural gas for peak shaving power stations and as fuel for vehicles and ships.Speed up the development of the new electric power system.Raise capacity for managing energy conservation across the board.

8588.0,"Law n ° 2019-1270 of December 2, 2019 of amending finance for 2019 (1)","French budget laws introduces a number of climate-related clauses, notably relating to the taxation system. Nota Bene: the figures below are representative of original changes and might have changed with more recent versions of the finance law.Carbon taxation: The budget law sets a trajectory for the carbon component of domestic consumption tax rates for the 2018-2022 period, with a more ambitious objective than that set by the law on the energy transition. Thus, the value of the carbon component of the tariffs for these taxes is set at 44.60 euros / tonne of CO2 in 2018 (instead of 39 euros initially), 55 euros in 2019 (against 47.5 euros) and 65, 40 euros in 2020 (against 56 euros), to reach 86.20 euros in 2022. In addition, it is expected in the new tariffs of TICPE (domestic consumption tax on energy products) a convergence of the tariff of diesel towards the gasoline tariffs in four years, ie by 2021. This measure leads to an increase in the fixed portion of the TICPE applicable to road diesel by € 2.6 per hectolitre per year for four years, which is in addition to that of the carbon portion programmed for the period 2018-2022. Used vehicles: The rate of the additional tax on the tax on the registration certificates of used vehicles has been tightened. The objective is to encourage buyers to equip themselves with less polluting vehicles.  Reinforcement of the ecological penalty on cars: The environmental penalty for automobiles has changed with successive finance laws. It remains based on the only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of vehicles without taking into account their pollutant emissions (fine particles, nitrogen oxides ...) but the trigger threshold of the malus has been lowered, originally from 127 to 120 grams of CO2 / km. The law set a progressive scale ranging from 50 euros for the least emitting vehicles to 10,500 euros for those emitting 185 g of CO2 / km or more.The finance law for 2022 further lowers the thresholds, increases the penalties and introduces a mass tax in working order (weight penalty) from January 1st, 2022. The tax on the mass in running order of the vehicle is set at € 10 per kg from 1,800 kg. The tax does not apply to vehicles used to transport persons suffering from disabilities and low-emissions vehicles. There are other exemptions, notably related to family size.   Premium conversion to electric vehicles: EUR 388 million has been earmarked in the budget of the special purpose account Aid for the acquisition of clean vehicles to finance aid for the acquisition of clean vehicles (EUR 266 million) and the withdrawal of vehicles more pollutants (€ 122 million).  Electric bicycles: Faced with the bronca caused by the decision not to maintain beyond 31 January 2018 the bonus for the purchase of an electric-assisted bicycle (e-bike), State aid was finally extended by 5 millions of euros. It is however conditional on the payment of aid by a local authority and refocused on the most modest households.  Energy transition tax credit (ISCED): The law of finance extends it for the year 2018 but hardens its conditions. As regards oil boilers, the eligibility criteria have been strengthened. The worst performers were excluded from ISCED as of January 1, 2018. In contrast, the eligibility of those meeting enhanced energy performance criteria, defined by decree, will be maintained until June 30, 2018 at a rate of 15%. The eligibility of glazed windows is maintained at a rate of 15%, only for taxpayers replacing single glazing with double glazing, until June 30, 2018.

The NCCS is structured as following: framework for the elaboration of the climate strategy; mitigation of climate change; adaptation to the changing climate; and implementation of the strategy. The reduction target for 2025 is reduction by 16% to 25% from the 1990 level in case of a unilateral 20% reduction by the EU, or 27% to 34% from the 1990 level in case of a conditional target reduction of 30% by the EU.

Monitoring is applicable to NCCS and also the NCCP, which is to be prepared by a set of indexes that reflect the climate change efficiency of the economy or the carbon reduction (e.g. GHG emission per GDP, emission per capita, energy intensity).

The NCCS identifies three major directions of actions for the long term climate change policy: to comply with EU and international requirements in order to reduce GHG emissions by reducing overall energy use; to fight against the unfavourable ecological and socio-economic effects of the inevitable climate change and improve adaptability to climate change impacts; and to raise social awareness of climate change.

1449.0,General Law on Climate Change,"The approval of the GLCC gives certainty and continuity to climate policy in Mexico and sets the country on a path to a low carbon economy. It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000. The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities. Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios. The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes. The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner. The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law. The law was amended in 2014 to establish a tax on fossil fuels, and in 2016 at article 94 to frame a carbon market. Attached regulation sets the framework for the accounting of carbon emissions.

1449.0,General Law Of Climate Change,"The approval of the GLCC gives certainty and continuity to climate policy in Mexico and sets the country on a path to a low carbon economy. It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000. The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities. Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios. The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes. The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner. The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law. The law was amended in 2014 to establish a tax on fossil fuels, and in 2016 at article 94 to frame a carbon market. Attached regulation sets the framework for the accounting of carbon emissions.

2023.0,Law on renewable energies,"This law provides a legal framework for the development of renewable energy projects in Morocco. These are defined as all sources of energy that are naturally renewable, particularly solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, wave and tidal energy, as well as energy generated through biomass, waste and biogas (but excluding hydraulic energy with installed power above 30MW). The law prioritises the development of renewable sources in order to promote energy security, access to energy, sustainable development, reduction of GHG emissions, reduction of deforestation, and integration/harmonisation of Morocco's renewable energy production with other Euro-Mediterranean markets.
Originally passed in 2010, the latest version from December 2015, introduces a net metering scheme for solar and wind power plants connected to the high-voltage grid, and in the future also those connected at the middle and low-voltage level. In particular, the law calls for regulation detailing the conditions for investors in solar-PV to benefit from opening of the low-voltage grid to renewable power installations. Private investors in renewable power in general will be able to sell their surplus output to the grid, but no more than 20 per cent of their annual production. The exact terms and conditions of the net metering scheme will be set by regulation.
The law further regulates the electricity sector and creates an authorisation/declaration system, depending on the capacity of the facility: a declaration is required if an electricity generating facility capacity is between 20kW and 2MW; an authorisation is required if an electricity generating facility capacity is equal to or higher than 2MW. In respect of facilities that produce thermal energy, there is only a declaration if the capacity is equal to or higher than 8MW. It also allows the supply and export of the electricity produced to the local market and/or through the national grid and interconnections with other countries.",MAR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaE1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ba0c0e366a69fdda323a979163b17d7c5abf67d2/f|,legislative,11/02/2010|Law passed||;21/04/2011|Regulation issued||;01/12/2015|Amended||,Energy;LULUCF;Waste,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Law,2010,French,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Renewables,,

9435.0,Decree-Law No. 85/2019,"This resolution approves the Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality of the Portuguese Economy in 2050. This Strategy also constitutes the document being sent to the UNFCCC according to Portugal's international commitments. The document materialises the government's 2016 pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the period. The strategy explores the feasibility of trajectories that lead to carbon neutrality, identifies the main vectors of decarbonisation and estimates the reduction potential of the various sectors of the national economy, such as energy and industry, mobility and transport , agriculture, forests and other land uses, and waste and wastewater.The resolution sets as an objective, for the purposes of the previous number, the reduction of GHG emissions for Portugal between 85% and 90% by 2050, compared to 2005, and the compensation of the remaining emissions through the use of soil and forests, to be achieved through a emission reduction trajectory between 45% and 55% by 2030, and between 65% and 75% by 2040, in relation to 2005.The document details the following vectors of decarbonisation:a) Decarbonise the production of electricity, eliminating the production of electricity from coal by 2030 and proceeding with the total decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050, betting on endogenous renewable resources;b) Implement the energy transition, significantly increasing energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, investing in the incorporation of endogenous renewable energy sources in final energy consumption, promoting electrification and adjusting the role of natural gas in the national energy system;c) Progressively decentralize and democratize energy production, giving emphasis to the role of the consumer as an active part of the energy system;d) Promote decarbonisation in the residential sector, favoring urban rehabilitation and increasing energy efficiency in buildings, promoting progressive electrification of the sector and the use of more efficient equipment, and combating energy poverty;e) Decarbonise mobility, favoring the mobility system in public transport, through its strengthening and decarbonization of fleets, supporting innovative and intelligent solutions for multimodal, active, shared and sustainable mobility, as well as electric mobility and other technologies zero emissions, together with a reduction in the carbon intensity of sea and air transport, focusing on innovation, efficiency and cleaner, renewable fuels, as well as the decarbonisation of short- and long-distance transport of goods, promoting a logistical chain with a modal split that minimizes the carbon and energy intensity of the transport system, reaffirming the role of maritime and fluvial transport in conjunction with rail freight;f) Promote the energy transition in industry, the incorporation of low carbon production processes and industrial symbiosis, promoting innovation and competitiveness;g) Betting on sustainable agriculture, through the significant expansion of conservation agriculture and precision agriculture, substantially reducing emissions associated with livestock and the use of fertilizers and promoting innovation;h) Foster carbon sequestration, through active agricultural and forest management, promoting the valorization of the territory;i) Changing the paradigm of using resources in production and consumption, abandoning the linear economic model and moving to a circular and low carbon economic model;j) Prevent the production of waste, increase recycling rates and very significantly reduce the deposition of waste in landfills;k) Streamline the participation of cities and local administrations in decarbonisation, encouraging an integrated approach to its different vectors, in particular mobility, buildings, services and waste management, and enhancing the role they have been playing in mitigating climate change;l) Stimulating research, innovation and knowledge production for neutrality in the various sectors of activity;m) Make taxation an instrument for the transition to neutrality, proceeding with the elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies, reinforcing the application of the carbon tax and promoting greater taxation on the use of resources, recycling revenues for decarbonization and fair transition ;n) Redirect financial flows to promote carbon neutrality, namely by promoting the development of a favorable framework for sustainable financing and greater involvement of the financial system, as well as the respective monitoring;o) Promote the involvement of society in the transition, contributing to increase individual and collective action, the adoption of sustainable behaviors and the alteration of production and consumption patterns in favor of sustainability, namely through environmental education and awareness;p) Promote the development of skills and (re) qualification directed towards new opportunities for economic development;q) Encourage the development of the new economy linked to energy transition and decarbonisation, supporting the development of new industrial and service clusters, and the generation of new business opportunities;r) Promote a fair and cohesive transition, which values ​​the

It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG.

1506.0,Electricity Act 1998,"The Electricity Act (E-Act) 1998 is an important basis for the creation of the electricity market in the Netherlands. By establishing this market, producers and suppliers of electricity were able to offer electricity on a market.

On April 9, 2018, the Energy Transition Act (wet VET) was adopted to amend the 1998 document and the Gas Act. The objective of this Act is to make the uptake of renewable energies in the country easier by reviewing extensively and in much detail the previous legal framework.

The Act allowed for distribution companies and large consumers could buy electricity from generators other than the local one. While the Act limited large-scale production to the existing generators, it also allowed self-generation by industry and CHP production by industrial firms or by joint ventures involving distribution companies. The Act forced distribution companies to take in all electricity that was locally generated and supplied to them, and to pay a feed-in tariff essentially equal to the avoided costs.

The E-Act also established, as of August 1, 1998, DTe, the independent regulator for the energy sector, as a chamber of the Dutch competition authority NMa. DTe was charged with supervising the sector and had the responsibility to guarantee non-discriminatory access to the grid for generators and to regulate the prices of the captive end users. The law forced energy companies to split their tariffs into network tariffs (including systems services) and tariffs for energy use as of the year 2000. DTe regulated the network tariffs and the final tariffs of the captive users, with the law imposing an RPI-X formula and the '1996=2000 principle' stating that overall prices in the year 2000 could not be higher than those that prevailed in 1996.

As of 1 April 2014, the regulation for the feed-in tariff (SDE+) for 2014 has opened. This regulation includes the following features: a budget ceiling is established for all types of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and hydro phased opening a ‘free category' to enhance investments in certain technologies; feed-in tariff granted for a certain period (5, 12 or 15 years); a maximum subsidy amount for the Netherlands, to be determined annually (EUR3.5bn, USD5.4bn in 2014).

1513.0,Climate Change Response Act 2002,"The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.  The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.",NZL,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcGtHIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a085e5c6e37040e3f55851174c5b0d3c101b8028/f|en,legislative,18/11/2002|Law passed||;25/12/2014|Last amendment||;01/11/2019|Amended by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act||;22/06/2020|Amended by the Emissions Trading Reform Act||,Agriculture;Economy-wide;LULUCF;Transportation;Waste,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Tax incentives|Economic;Capacity building|Governance;Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;MRV|Governance",Mitigation,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Act,2002,English,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Carbon Pricing;Redd+ And Lulucf,,

It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times. The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.  The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.  The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.  The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.",NZL,https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0022/latest/whole.html#LMS143384|en,legislative,18/11/2002|Law passed||;25/12/2014|Last amendment||;01/11/2019|Amended by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act||;22/06/2020|Amended by the Emissions Trading Reform Act||,Agriculture;Economy-wide;LULUCF;Transportation;Waste,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Tax incentives|Economic;Capacity building|Governance;Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;MRV|Governance",Mitigation,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Act,2020,English,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Carbon Pricing;Redd+ And Lulucf,,

- to strengthen the scientific research system necessary to developing biofuels
- to educate workers about innovative fuel technologies
- to incentivise the application of biofuel technologies
- to incentivise private capital investment in biofuel production
- to incentivise the commercialisation of biofuels
- to promote the production of biofuels in rainforest regions within the framework of sustainable development

The Law outlines co-ordination with anti-drug programmes, so that national and interna-tional funds designated to The War on Drugs are used to incentivise farmers to cultivate crops designated for biofuels rather than production of coca plants.

2054.0,Supreme Decree No. 011-2015-MINAM: They approve the national strategy against climate change,"The National Strategy on Climate Change (ENCC) 2015 updates and replaces the ENCC originally adopted in 2003. It reflects the commitment of the Peruvian State to take action on climate change in an integrated, cross-cutting and multi-sectoral manner, aiming to fulfil the ""Vision for 2021"", when ""Peru will have adapted to the adverse effects of and taken advantage of the opportunities posed by climate change, laying the foundation for sustainable low carbon development"".

The Strategy identifies key climate risks for the country, such as glacial retreat and reduced access to the associated water resources, unusual variation of temperatures on land and in the sea, changing historical patterns of rainfall, rising sea levels, and the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. It also assesses the distribution of GHG emissions throughout the Peruvian economy.

Based on the two above assessments, the ENCC sets two key objectives, each with 4 associated indicators :



Prevent the adverse impacts of climate change from reducing the vulnerability of the economy and society to such impacts, raising awareness among the population and implementing adaptation actions in appropriate scale. The associated indicators are:



Increased proportion of people who know what actions to take to manage climate change risks and adapt to the impacts







Increased volume of private investment and increased quality of public expenditure for climate change adaptation







Reduced human and economic losses due to the occurrence of natural disasters linked to climate change







Increased production of scientific research and technological development as a basis and guide for climate change risk management and adaptation to climate change













Reduce GHG emissions, while taking advantage of the opportunities associated productive transformation in key sectors such as forestry, energy, transportation, industrial and solid waste management.



Reduced and continuously decreasing carbon intensity of the economy







Reduction of GHG emissions in all sectors, especially carbon intensive sectors







Increased carbon sequestration and net reduction of emissions in the forestry sector

2054.0,National Strategy against Climate Change 2015,"The National Strategy on Climate Change (ENCC) 2015 updates and replaces the ENCC originally adopted in 2003. It reflects the commitment of the Peruvian State to take action on climate change in an integrated, cross-cutting and multi-sectoral manner, aiming to fulfil the ""Vision for 2021"", when ""Peru will have adapted to the adverse effects of and taken advantage of the opportunities posed by climate change, laying the foundation for sustainable low carbon development"".

The Strategy identifies key climate risks for the country, such as glacial retreat and reduced access to the associated water resources, unusual variation of temperatures on land and in the sea, changing historical patterns of rainfall, rising sea levels, and the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. It also assesses the distribution of GHG emissions throughout the Peruvian economy.

Based on the two above assessments, the ENCC sets two key objectives, each with 4 associated indicators :



Prevent the adverse impacts of climate change from reducing the vulnerability of the economy and society to such impacts, raising awareness among the population and implementing adaptation actions in appropriate scale. The associated indicators are:



Increased proportion of people who know what actions to take to manage climate change risks and adapt to the impacts







Increased volume of private investment and increased quality of public expenditure for climate change adaptation







Reduced human and economic losses due to the occurrence of natural disasters linked to climate change







Increased production of scientific research and technological development as a basis and guide for climate change risk management and adaptation to climate change













Reduce GHG emissions, while taking advantage of the opportunities associated productive transformation in key sectors such as forestry, energy, transportation, industrial and solid waste management.



Reduced and continuously decreasing carbon intensity of the economy







Reduction of GHG emissions in all sectors, especially carbon intensive sectors







Increased carbon sequestration and net reduction of emissions in the forestry sector











The ENCC mandates the production of sectoral and sub-national action plans, setting specific targets and detailing measures necessary to achieve the objectives proposed in ENCC. These are to be monitored and evaluated by the National Commission on Climate Change.

2010.0,Act on renewable energy sources,"This Act defines the new regime for support to renewable energy sources (including wind energy, energy radiation of the sun, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal energy, hydropower, waves, currents error and tidal energy obtained from biomass, biogas, agricultural biogas and bioliquid - art. 2.22), aiming to stabilise the long-term support system, with the goal to prevent electricity prices form increasing in an uncontrolled manner. The Act also transposes the Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy into Polish legislation and aims to contribute to Poland's target of reaching 15% share of renewable energy production by 2020. The Act will provide continuing support to most existing installations (in operation by or before 31 December 2015) through certificates of origin, while future investments will compete for support through an auction system organised by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO). The auctions, applying to new installations over 10 kW of installed capacity, will be based on a type of contract-for-difference (CfD) granted, with separate auctions for old and new plants and for plants of 1 MW or less, as well as varied reference prices for the eighteen renewable sources reference groups. The chosen renewable plants will have to start generation within 24 months (solar plants), 72 months (wind plants) or 48 months (others), and they will be required to deliver at least 85% of the volume offered in the bid, under threat of penalty. The energy auctioned will be bought by the newly formed state-owned entity Operator Rozlicze? Energii Odnawialnej (for energy produced in installations above 500kW) or by electricity distribution companies (for energy produced in installations up to 500kW). Most existing installations will also be eligible to change to the auction support instrument from the current certificates of origin, except for hydropower plants over 5 MW, non-qualified biomass co-firing installations (art. 44) and biomass installations exceeding 50 MW of electrical power (or 150 MW of CHP power). The existing installations will continue to be eligible for the existing system of support through certificates of origin (introduced through the 1997 Energy Law), but a number of limits will apply: support for max 15 years from the start of renewable energy production in the given installation;support for hydropower of max 5 MW of capacity;support for biomass co-firing installations of less than 150 MW capacity capped to equivalent of the average generation over 2011-2013;large consumers (over 100 GWh of electricity consumed annually) and commodity brokerage houses are required to obtain certificates of origin for 14% and 15% of their annual electricity consumption for 2015 and 2016 respectively or pay the substitution fee. From 2017 the share is min 20%, but can be reduced by the Minister of Economy, if necessary due to specific market conditions. A unit substitution fee is set to a constant 300.03 PLN/MWh (2014 level, approx. 72 €/MWh), which should stabilise the price of certificates, as purchasing and redeeming of certificates of origin will only be allowed if the average market price of certificates remains below 75% of the substitution fee.The Act also introduces a feed-in tariff system for micro installations of up to 10 kW (max 40 kW under special conditions - art. 41.7), while guaranteeing purchase by electricity distribution companies at 100% of market price for the next 15 years, until no later than December 31, 2035 (art. 41.5). The support also covers the so-called ‘prosumers,' who both produce and consume their own electricity. The subsidies amount to PLN 0.75 (EUR 0.18) per kWh to prosumers with a capacity of up to 3 kW (hydropower, wind, solar), and PLN 0.40-0.70 (EUR 0.10-0.17) for those with a capacity between 3 and 10 kW (biogas, hydropower, wind, solar). Moreover, there are no licensing/concession requirements for those micro generators that do not have active business.

The 2015 update also enlarges the list of 'renewable sources' to include wave energy, ocean currents energy and biofuels, and it expands the support of the Programme and Fund to hydropower plants with capacity up to 50 MW (up from original 30 MW).This law was amended several times, notably by law 27191 and by a number of resolutions including resolution 285/2018 and resolution 742/2021.The market regime for the production of renewable energy is regulated by resolution 281/2017 and amending resolution 551/2021. ",ARG,https://www.argentina.gob.ar/normativa/nacional/decreto-531-2016-259883|es,legislative,02/01/2007|Law passed||;15/10/2015|Amended by law 27191||;03/08/2021|Amended by resolution 742/2021||,Energy,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Tax incentives|Economic;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Decree,2016,Spanish,Research And Development;Energy Supply,,

The plan further encourages industrial users to increase their average consumption of ethanol by 11% in the next 10 years; brings forward the 5% biodiesel blending requirement from 2013 to 2010; and supports the creation of an international biofuels market. The Plan determines that a National Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be created to reduce electricity consumption by 10% by 2030 and to establish other measures such as incentives to replace old electric equipment with modern equipment, and create improvements in industry energy efficiency, transportation and buildings. The Plan promotes a sustainable increase in the use of biofuels in the national transportation network and establishes measures on adaptation to climate change. The plan establishes that actions should be taken to eliminate the loss of national forest cover by 2015. The plan sets targets for a consistent cut on deforestation to be accomplished in subsequent four-year periods. The goal is to reduce deforestation by 40% in the 2006-2009 period in relation to the Amazon Fund's 10-year reference period (1996-2005).

The strategy, in turn, consists of a set of recommendations and guidelines to be followed in defining the actions and initiatives to be implemented throughout the 2050 horizon. These, in turn, need to be defined in an Action Plan to be prepared following the approval of the PNE 2050. The document notably prioritises the expansion of hydropower capacity, of oil and gas production, the analysis of promotion mechanisms for a range of renewables, research and development, and increased efficiency.The PNE 2030 is the first study of integrated planning of energy resources held within the Brazilian government, and prepared by the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil (MME). It proposes a strategic direction for expansion of energy supply. Its estimate of future electricity needs is based on a forecast percentage growth in demand per annum corresponding to an average GDP growth per annum. The PNE is composed of a series of studies that seek to provide inputs to formulate energy policies according to an integrated view of available resources. As a contribution to meeting that future estimated demand, the MME proposes 164GW as the country's ‘exploitable, but as yet unrealised' hydropower ‘potential'. Of that 164GW, the MME says that 90% (about 147GW) is in the Amazon region. If realised, this figure would amount to more than a doubling of the total installed national electricity generation capacity in Brazil - 121GW in 2012 (from all generation sources). The PNE provides for the expansion of the electricity sector by 2030 with the use of energy sources: (1) Renewables - 191.35GW (92GW existed in 2010), (2) Conventional thermoelectric - 21.5GW (16GW existed in2010), and (3) Nuclear- 8GW (2GW existed in 2010).

It was adopted by the European Council in October 2014 as a strategic document, although binding legislation is yet to be drafted. It includes the binding 2030 EU domestic GHG reduction target of at least 40% compared to 1990, as well as a target of at least 27% for final renewable energy, and a at least 27% for energy savings by 2030 (target to be reviewed upwards to 30% in 2020). In addition, the EU ETS is to be reformed and strengthened. To achieve the 2030 binding 40% reduction target, the sectors covered by the EU ETS would have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005. In parallel, emissions from non-EU ETS sectors would need to be cut by 30% below the 2005 level, through national measures. To address the surplus of emission allowances in the EU ETS and to improve the system's resilience, a market stability reserve is to be established and the annual factor to reduce the cap on the maximum permitted emissions is to be changed from the current 1.74% to 2.2% from 2021. The volume of free allowances is to be reduced progressively; Member States with a GDP per capita below 60% of the EU average may opt to continue to give free allowances to the energy sector up to 2030, but the maximum amount handed out for free after 2020 should be no more than 40% of the allowances allocated to eligible Member States. The 2030 Framework stresses the importance of a fully functioning and connected EU energy market, as foreseen in the European Energy Security Strategy (2014).

A consumer's body authorised by the Cabinet of Ministers issues a document confirming the purchase of energy generated from alternative energy sources. It also establishes that the wholesale electricity market must buy the green tariff electricity from alternative energy sources, and sell it directly to consumers or energy supplying companies.  Green tariff is defined as a special tariff for electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy (except blast-furnace and coke gases; with regard to hydropower - at small plants only, i.e. with capacity up to 10 MWel).  The amended Law obliges the Ukrainian wholesale electricity providers to purchase electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy through the green tariff. The green tariff was planned as a double average tariff for traditional electricity sold on the Ukrainian wholesale market in the year preceding the year of the tariff decision.  The state regulator (NKRE) defines the Green Tariff based on a formula. Special fed-in (green) tariffs were established for wind, solar, biomass, biogas, small hydro (<10MW) and geothermal power plants. Green Tariffs are fixed until 2030 with guaranteed electricity of-take by the Wholesale Electricity Market Operator. Green Tariffs are revised on a monthly basis to follow changes in UAH/EUR currency exchange rate.

1755.0,Climate Change Act 2008,"The Act provides a long-term framework to improve carbon management, to help the transition to a low carbon economy, encourage investment in low carbon goods and provide an international signal. The Act establishes a legally binding target for the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It also creates 5-yearly 'carbon budgets' as a pathway to meet the long-term target. The Act has now established a legally binding target of at least an 100% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, to be achieved through action in the UK and abroad. Ministers must report on the policies implemented to meet carbon budgets and produce an annual report to Parliament on the status of UK emissions. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an independent, expert body to advise the government on the level of carbon budgets and on progress in meeting these budgets - submits annual reports to Parliament on progress towards targets and budgets. The government must respond to the reports, ensuring transparency and accountability. The Act sets up a carbon budgeting system that caps emissions over 5-year periods, with three budgets set at a time, to help the UK stay on track for its 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets run from 2008-2012, 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, and were set in law in May 2009. The fourth carbon budget, for 2023-2027 approved by parliament in 2011 and reviewed in 2014, puts into law a target to reduce emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2025 (the midpoint of the budget period). The government must report to Parliament its policies and proposals to meet the budgets and set a limit on the purchase of carbon credits for each budgetary period - for the first budgetary period, a zero limit was set in May 2009, excluding units bought by UK participants in the EU Emissions Trading System. For the second budget period, a limit of 55MtCO2e was set. The Act also gives powers to introduce domestic emissions trading schemes more quickly and easily through secondary legislation - the first use has been to introduce the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. The Act introduced measures on biofuels and powers to introduce pilot financial incentive schemes in England for household waste. The Act requires, by the end of 2012, the inclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions in the net carbon account, or an explanation to Parliament why not. The government announced in December 2012 that this decision would be deferred, recognising uncertainty over the international framework for reducing aviation emissions and particularly the treatment of aviation within the EU ETS. The new net zero target still excludes aviation and shipping. The government must report at least every 5 years on the risks to the UK of climate change, and publish a programme setting out how these will be addressed. The first such climate change risk assessment was published in 2012. The Act also introduces powers for government to require public bodies and statutory undertakers to carry out their own risk assessment and make plans to address those risks. The Act introduces an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, providing advice to, and scrutiny of, the Government's adaptation work. ****** The fifth carbon budget (adopted in June 2016) has set emission reduction levels to 57% compared with 1990 levels. It covers the period between 2028-2032 and is in line with the UK's global commitments.

1765.0,Energy Act 2013,"The Contracts for Difference scheme is the current main mechanism for supporting large-scale generation of renewable electricity. It is a market-based mechanism, designed to provide a substantial incentive for all eligible forms of renewable electricity. CfDs incentivise investment in renewable energy by providing developers of projects with high upfront costs and long lifetimes with direct protection from volatile wholesale prices, and they protect consumers from paying increased support costs when electricity prices are high. The Scheme is administered by the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a private company administered by BEIS.The Contracts for Difference Scheme replaces the Renewables Obligation scheme which was closed to new generating capacity in 2017.The Renewables Obligation (RO) placed an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to source a specified and annually increasing proportion of their electricity sales from renewable sources, or pay a penalty. The obligation for 2009/10 was 9.7%, rising to 15.4% by 2015/6. Previously, one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) was issued for each MWh of eligible generation, regardless of technology. In 2009, reforms gave new generators joining the RO different numbers of ROCs, depending on the costs and potential for large-scale deployment. New projects in more expensive technologies like offshore wind now receive more support and those that are more economic, like landfill gas, receive less. Generators can sell their ROCs to electricity supply companies, which use them to demonstrate compliance with the Obligation. This enabled generators to receive a premium on top of the sale of the electricity. In 2010, changes to the scheme included the end date of the RO being extended to 2037, in order to provide greater long-term certainty for investors, and an increase in support for offshore wind projects meeting certain criteria.  The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the RO.

1783.0,Environmental Management and Conservation Act No.12 of 2002 (Consolidated Edition 2004),"The 2002 Act forms the basis of environmental legislation in Vanuatu andfocuses on four main areas:
- Administration
- Environmental impact assessments
- Biodiversity
- Bio-prospecting laws and community conservation areas (CCAs)

The Amendment Act makes a number of important changes directly relevant to climate change.It includes a definition of climate change ('a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods', page 3), adds the concept of ecosystem services and processes to the Act, and applies the precautionary principle to any decision made regarding the environment that may risk human health or threaten damage to the environment. It also specifies that any decision made under the terms of the Act must be guided by consideration of climate change adaptation and mitigation issues.

The Act requires that the director of the department responsible for the environment must include in their Environmental Registry a climate change database in joint co-ordination with the National Advisory Committee on Climate Change. It also requires that the National State of the Environment Report, published at least once every 10 years, must include a description of national climate change activities, impacts and issues. It requires that climatic considerations and issues be incorporated into any National Policy for the conservation, sustainable development and management of the environment. Further, it specifically identifies climate mitigation as a critical ecosystem service that may be provided by sites of national biodiversity significance and enables the Minister to make any regulations necessary to uphold Vanuatu's obligations under the UNFCCC for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

It establishes an Environmental Trust Fund, funded by penalties and bonds, which is to fund research, environmental rehabilitation, monitoring and analysis, management of community conservation areas, and as required for the protection and conservation of the environment.It also makes several amendments to enforcement provisions, environmental impact assessment procedures, bio-prospecting processes, and details of what constitutes an offence (and the associated punishments) under the 2002 Act.",VUT,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBa1FJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--089018cf4b5b08ccd9dcae23f20d3eafedd88808/f|,legislative,24/01/2011|Law passed,Environment;Health,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Act,2004,English,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development,,

It helps prevent a regulatory vacuum until the complete revision of the CO2 law comes into force. The amendment to the ordinance also aims to implement a requirement of Parliament, namely a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.5% in 2021 compared to 1990. The Swiss people refused the law's full revision in June 2021.The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC.

The version in force and the 2020 Ordinance 641.711 have been amended to cover the period post 1.1.2020. The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are: - Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad - CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met - The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund. - CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations). - If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy - Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects - National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme - Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading - Prepare linking with EU ETS - Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74% - Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year - Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned - The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products - Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars. Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings). The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources. One third of the revenues (and no more than CHF300m USD313.4m) from the CO2 tax and cantonal funds are channelled into the Building programme. Two updates of the programme were necessary as a result of its popularity.

1689.0,Adaptation to climate change in Switzerland,"The Swiss National Adaptation Strategy aims to serve as framework for the federal offices to adapt a co-ordinated course of action in response to adverse climate effects. It is spilt into two parts. The Strategy describes the goals, challenges and fields of action in adapting to climate change in Switzerland. The overall goal of the strategy is to seize the opportunities provided by climate change, to minimise climate change related risks and to improve the adaptive capacity of society, the environment and the economy.  The first part examines the climate change impacts and identifies the most important fields of action of adaptation to climate change in the following sectors: - Natural hazard management - Water management - Agriculture - Forestry - Energy - Tourism - Biodiversity management - Health - Spatial development.  The second part of the strategy is an action plan to reach the strategy's goals. These measures are co-ordinated between the federal offices in order to address the challenges posed by climate change, i.e., effects of heat waves in urban areas, droughts, floods, increasing slope instabilities in the Alps, decreasing snow cover, adverse effects on water, soil and air quality, changes in biodiversity, and the potential spreading of invasive species, vermin and infectious diseases. The adaptation measures need to be carefully aligned with other cross-cutting strategies of the Federal Council.  12 cross-sectoral challenges are identified, including: - Greater heat stress on agglomerations and cities - Increasing levels of summer drought - Greater risk of flooding - Decreasing slope stability and more frequent mass wasting - Rising snowline - Impaired water, soil and air quality - Change in habitats, species, composition and landscapes - Spread of harmful organisms, diseases and alien species.  Co-ordinated approach includes the following: - Working with the cantons, cities and municipalities - In the context of sectoral policies - Cross-collaboration and coordination - International cooperation on adaptation to climate change -International climate negotiations - Adapting to climate change in Europe - Collaboration with neighbouring countries.",CHE,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1689%20French.pdf|fr,executive,09/04/2014|Law passed,Economy-wide;Energy;Environment;Transportation;Urban;Water,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Zoning & Spatial Planning|Regulation;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;MRV|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",Adaptation,Adaptation,Flood;Drought;Glacial;Floods;Droughts;Landslides;Changes In Air Quality;Changes In Soil Quality;Changes In Average Precipitation;Changes In Surface Water;Change In Air Quality;Heatwaves;Heat Waves;Change In Surface Water;Changes In Average Temperature;Glacial Melting;Change In Soil Quality;Changes In Precipitation;Change In Average Temperature,Strategy,2012,French,Adaptation;Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development,,

Its principal goals include: - ensure production and distribution of economic power, compatible with the requirements of environmental protection - promote the efficient and rational use of energy - encourage the use of indigenous and renewable energy. The Act provides three main targets, to be reached in co-operation with the Cantons, the energy sector and other stakeholders: - The average annual electricity production from renewable sources is to be increased by at least 5,400 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000. Up to 10% of the required target can be met by renewable electricity generation abroad (e.g.CDM). - The average annual hydro-power production is to increase by at least 2,000 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000 - Households' final energy consumption must be stabilised by 2030 at the level it would have had at the entry into force of this provision (2009). Among the measures put forward by the Act to meet the above targets are certification of electricity origin (renewable electricity certificates), preferential installation of new renewable electricity or CHP compared to fossil fuel plants, mandatory offtake for renewable electricity for utilities (conditions apply) with financial support for solar PV plants (30kW max), and energy labelling for buildings, vehicles and appliances.  The Energy Ordinance specifies the provisions of the Energy Act: It includes provisions for a feed-in tariff for electricity from solar PV, wind, hydro (up to 10MW), geothermal and biomass. The payments are made for 10, 20 or 25 years and are differentiated according to application, technology and size of the installation. They only apply to installations built, renovated or expanded after 1 January 2006.

1723.0,Law on the use of renewable energy resources for the production of electrical energy,"This Act (also known as the Renewable Energy Law) encourages the use of renewable energy. This law encompasses the procedures and principles of the conservation of renewable energy resource areas, certification of the energy generated from these sources, and use of these sources.   The measurable objective is to increase the amount of electricity produced by renewable sources by 30% by 2023.  The Act governs the principles for the conservation of renewable resource areas and introduces incentives for domestic energy projects, providing feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable energy sources. The legal entity holding a generation licence is granted a \Renewable Energy Resource Certificate\ (RES Certificate) by the Electricity Markets Regulation Authority (EMRA) to identify and monitor the resource type in purchasing and sale of the electrical energy generated from renewable energy resources in the domestic and international markets.  It creates a broad basis for an emerging domestic renewable energy market. Grid operators are obliged to provide access to the grid for renewable energy generators, and independent power producers can benefit from the feed-in tariff. Holders of energy retail licences are obliged to purchase a percentage of their total uptake from licensed generation companies holding a RES Certificate.  The price of the electricity to be purchased under the Act should be the nationwide average of the electricity wholesale price of the previous year (determined by the EMRA). However a producer can sell the electrical energy generated for a higher price in the market if they are able to.  Some highlights of the law include: - The reduction or cancellation of service fees as an incentive for those willing to build energy generation facilities to meet their own energy consumption needs. - Further incentives are available through a Council of Minister's Decree, such as investments for energy generation facilities, procurement of electro-mechanic systems within the country, research, development and production investments concerning solar energy units, and research and development investments for biomass energy. - Where there are sufficient geothermal energy resources, demand will be primarily met by geothermal and solar thermal energy resources. - In the event that the forests and the lands under private ownership of the Treasury or under the control or disposal of the State are used to generate electricity from renewable energy resources, these areas are leased to or right of way is given to the relevant parties. Any fees required for using this land is reduced by 85%. The law also stipulates that development plans that might have a negative impact on the use and efficiency of renewable energy resource areas can no longer be created on public land.The Act was amended in March 2020 by articles 26 and 27 of law 7226 to enable the Ministry of energy and renewable resources to ease the expropriation of private properties to build renewable capacity. Furthermore, it amends the procedures and principles regarding the evaluation of tariffs applied to support electricity production based on renewable energy sources and other revenues within the scope of the RES Support Mechanism, to grant the Ministry the power to regulate them.The Presidential Decree No.31248 sets out : 1) the prices in Schedule I in the Law will be applied until December 31, 2030 for Renewable Energy Resources (RER) certified production license holders that initiate their operations under the RER support mechanism between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021; 2) if the mechanical and/or electro-mechanical parts used in the RER-certified production facilities that initiate their operations between January 1, 2021 ad June 30, 2021 are manufactued domestically, the prices in Schedule II in the Law will be applied to the prices in Schedule I, for additional five years from the date os operation of the production facility for the electrical energy produced.",TUR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBc3dLIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--082278d03b7ab27b361eb64a9a8dc30eabd81719/1723%20Turkish.pdf|tr,legislative,18/05/2005|Law passed||;29/12/2010|Amended by law 6094||;26/04/2020|Amended by law 7226||;18/09/2020|Approved||,Energy;LULUCF,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation",,Mitigation,,Law,2005,Turkish,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand,,

1723.0,Law on Amendment of Some Laws,"This Act (also known as the Renewable Energy Law) encourages the use of renewable energy. This law encompasses the procedures and principles of the conservation of renewable energy resource areas, certification of the energy generated from these sources, and use of these sources.   The measurable objective is to increase the amount of electricity produced by renewable sources by 30% by 2023.  The Act governs the principles for the conservation of renewable resource areas and introduces incentives for domestic energy projects, providing feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable energy sources. The legal entity holding a generation licence is granted a \Renewable Energy Resource Certificate\ (RES Certificate) by the Electricity Markets Regulation Authority (EMRA) to identify and monitor the resource type in purchasing and sale of the electrical energy generated from renewable energy resources in the domestic and international markets.  It creates a broad basis for an emerging domestic renewable energy market. Grid operators are obliged to provide access to the grid for renewable energy generators, and independent power producers can benefit from the feed-in tariff.

1298.0,Governmental Decree No.2019 of 2008 adopting the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan,"This Decree adopts the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP). The first NEEAP outlined the existing planned energy efficiency measures to decrease the energy consumption by 1% annually during the nine years between 2008 and 2016. The objectives of the NEEAP I are as follows: alignment of Hungary's energy policy initiatives with those of the EU; finding the most cost-effective solutions for utilization of energy-saving potential; shaping consumer awareness and influencing the market in order to achieve long-term energy efficiency; informing market players of the structure and time frame of the plans; realization of the EU's energy efficiency expectations of member states; and consideration of climate protection aspects. According to the NEEAP and the Governmental decree No.64 of 2009, the Ministry of National Development (former Ministry of Transport, Telecommunication and Energy) is responsible for the preparation of NEEAPs. Co-ordination of the implementation of NEEAP and the verification of its progress falls under the responsibility of the Energy Centre, a government-owned energy efficiency, environment and energy information agency non-profit company. It is the national agency responsible for energy efficiency and renewable energy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Plan also notes that actions including the following could further save energy:extension of state aid to upgrade household appliances and lightbulbs; state aid to develop energy saving awareness activities; making the use of energy efficient office equipment obligatory; promotion of the dissemination of energy-saving building technologies; and strengthening the energy aspect of environmental and traffic safety considerations in connection with the import of used vehicles.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The NEEAP was modified in 2010 under the Governmental Decision No.1076 of 2010 on the Modified National Energy Efficiency Action Plan of Hungary (MNEEAP) and the second NEEAP (NEEAP II) was adopted under the Governmental Decision No.1374 of 2011. The NEEAP II includes shortcomings and an action plan aiming to solve them, national energy saving targets and measures in energy end-use, sectoral measures for energy saving and institutions responsible for implementation and monitoring.

- Knowledge economy: developing a competitive knowledge economy through value addition<br />
- Connectivity: modernising transport infrastructure and regional connectivity.<br />
<br />
While the overall direction of the document is development of the country, climate change is considered as one of the challenges the country would face that requires mitigation and adaptation. Pakistan's vulnerabilities are seen as an important challenge of its transition towards a high level of sustained growth. Following vulnerabilities and challenges are mentioned in the document:<br />
- Water security: current water availability is less than 1,100 cubic meters per person, down from 5,000 cubic meters in 1951; Pakistan's water storage capacity is limited to 30 days<br />
- Food security: Pakistan ranks 76th of the 107 countries on the Global Food Security Index<br />
- Glacial melt: Indus basin (water reservoir) affected by the glaciers in the Hindukush-Karakoram and Himalayas<br />
- Biodiversity threat caused by climate change: habitat destruction and alteration, biotechnology (such as basmati rice, turmeric and neem) and threats of genetically modified seeds and germplasm to indigenous species<br />
- Energy security: alternative energy<br />
- Institutions that favour the status quo<br />
- Infrastructure bottleneck.<br />
<br />
The Vision 2025 stands upon the target fulfilment of the MDGs and SDGs by 2030. The document also sets out 25 goals in accordance to the 7 pillars. The goals that are related to the purpose of this study are as follows:<br />

<br />
This new version keeps the target of a 40% decrease of energy intensity of the economy between 2007 and 2020, but alters the 4.5% share of electricity generation from renewable energy sources target to 2.5% by 2020 (excluding large hydro over 25 MW). The Programme calls for diverse measures to attain those targets, including:<br />
- evaluating the technological and economic potential of efficient renewables use<br />
- providing subsidies from the state budget in order to compensate for the costs of grid connection for renewables<br />
- installation of smart meters (18.9% of metering devices by 2020)<br />
- increasing the availability of energy infrastructure - reducing the number of steps required to gain access to the grid (from 8 to 5) and reducing the delay of connection to the grid (from 276 to 40 days)<br />
- raising public awareness on energy conservation and energy efficiency.<br />

1605.0,Rwanda Vision 2020,"Vision 2020 is a framework for Rwanda's development, presenting the key priorities and providing Rwandans with a guiding tool for the future. It seeks to transform Rwanda into a middle-income country by the year 2020. This will require achieving annual per capita income of USD900 (USD290 today), a poverty rate of 30% (64% today) and an average life expectance of 55 years (49 years today).<br />
<br />
The framework includes the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure as a crucial aspect in lowering the costs of doing business. It calls for: (i) a modern land law providing security of tenure and freedom of exchange; (ii) the development of alternative lower costs of transport to the sea; and (iii) increase of energy production and diversification into alternative energy sources. Rwanda has considerable hydroelectric potential, in addition to large deposits of renewable methane gas in Lake Kivu, estimated at 60bn m3. In rural areas direct solar energy or photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155m tons of peat deposit is currently exploitable. Rwanda projects that by 2020, at least 35% of the population will be connected to electricity (up from the current 6%).<br />
<br />
Vision 2020 recognises sustainable environmental and climate change management as a cross-cutting pivotal area to the realisation of national aspirations. It recognises that the major problem in environmental protection is the imbalance between the population and the natural resources. This leads to alarming degradation observed through massive deforestation, the depletion of biodiversity, erosion and landslides, pollution of waterways and the degradation of fragile ecosystems.<br />
<br />
To protect the environment against massive deforestation and soil destruction, Vision 2020 sets the target for the protection rate against erosion to rise from 20% in 2000 to 90% by year 2020. To ease the pressure on wood biomass seeing that 86.3% of the Rwandan population uses wood as the source of energy, Vision 2020 targets to drop the use of wood energy in national energy balance, to 50% by 2020 through diversification of energy sources availed to the population.",RWA,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdDRJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--cdb6779e4374d0d21f7e4e9c6678ee8854c3d70c/f|,executive,01/07/2000|Law passed,Energy;Environment;LULUCF;Transportation;Water,"Other|Direct Investment;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Vision,,,Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Redd+ And Lulucf;Transportation,Rwanda,

All self-consumers connected to the grid (see below) have to be registered with the Registry for Electrical Energy Self-Consumption, even if they do not ever intend on selling any surplus energy that they generate to the grid (isolated facilities exempt).<br />
There are two self-consumption modalities:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>'supply with self-consumption' - consumer with a contracted power of maximum 100 kW, owning at least one generation facility within its internal network, not registered as production facility</li><br />
<li>'production with self-consumption' - consumer associated to at least one generation facility connected within its network; the total power of the production facilities must be lower or equal to the consumer contracted power</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Decree allows for electricity storage devices installed within the self-consumption facilities, but makes them financially unattractive.<br />
All self-consumers have to pay 'access tolls' to the grid to contribute to its maintenance and operations. Tolls depend on the real use of the grid (contracted power and energy introduced in the border point). Under the second modality, 'access tolls' for feeding energy to the network are to be paid. In addition, all self-consumers have to pay the ""charges associated to the electricity system cost"", as well as the 'charge for other services of the system' (i.e. back-up of the self-consumer's facilities provided by the electrical system; can vary or be exempt for non-mainland territories and low voltage consumers - under 10 kW). Some existing facilities (e.g. cogeneration, small generation of <50 MW) are temporarily exempt from the charges until 31 December 2019.<br />
Both types of self-consumers can purchase additional electricity. However, only facilities registered under the second modality are entitled to receive a financial compensation for providing electricity to the grid.
