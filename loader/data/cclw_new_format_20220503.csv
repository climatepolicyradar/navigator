1385.0,National energy strategy: for a more competitive and sustainable energy,"The National Energy Strategy (NES), which has a double time horizon (2020 and 2050), directs efforts towards substantially improving the competitiveness of the energy system and environmental sustainability. The results expected by 2020 are:1) Wholesale prices of all energy sources will be aligned with average European average price levels, resulting in savings of about EUR9bn (USD11.3bn)/year in the overall power and gas bill (from current EUR70bn (USD87.8bn) - assuming same commodity prices).2) Expenditure on energy imports will be reduced by about EUR14bn (USD17.6bn)/year from the present EUR62bn (USD77.8bn), and dependency on foreign supplies from 84% to 67%, thanks to energy efficiency, increased production from renewables, lower electricity imports and increased production from national resources. 3) Private investment of EUR180bn (USD213bn) will be supported by incentives between now and 2020 in renewables and energy efficiency and in traditional sectors (electricity and gas networks, re-gasification plants, storage, hydrocarbon development).4) GHG emissions will fall by about 21% compared to the 2005 level, exceeding the European 20-20-20 targets for Italy.5) Renewable energy sources will account for 19-20% of gross final consumption (compared with about 10% in 2010). This is equivalent to 22-23% of primary energy consumption, while fossil fuel use will fall from 86% to 76%. Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).6) Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures. To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:1) Fostering Energy Efficiency2) Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices3) Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\20-20-20\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive4) Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production5) Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level6) Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection7) Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient8) Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:1) The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical2) The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure3) A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport4) The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario",ITA,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaE1HIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--76ef762e995acedaa724541f478f6b4d776afd78/f|it,executive,08/03/2013|Law passed||;25/12/2017|Approved||,Energy;Industry;Residential and Commercial;Transportation,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",,Mitigation,,Strategy,2013,Italian,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand,,

The objectives of the Policy Framework are: To mainstream climate change considerations into national policies and development planning and to build the country's capacity to implement climate change adaptation and mitigation activities.To support the institutions responsible for research, monitoring and projections on climate change, to facilitate decision-making and strategic actions at all levels.To facilitate and coordinate the national response to the impacts of climate change and promote low carbon development.To improve communication at all levels on climate change impacts and also adaptation and mitigation related opportunities.To mobilize climate financing for adaptation and mitigation initiatives.To encourage the private sector to embrace climate change imperatives and promote the development and implementation of technologies and processes that contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives.  On the basis of this Policy Framework, relevant sectors are to develop or update individual plans addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation, taking into account the following principles: Sustainable use of natural resourcesMulti-sectoral approach to climate changePublic participation and collaborationThe Precautionary ApproachTransparency and accountabilityBest sciencePolluter Pays PrincipleInter- and intra-generational equity The Policy Framework also provides for specific strategies, legislation and policies to be adopted and implemented, including: Enactment of framework for climate change mitigation and adaptation;Development of a Climate Financing Strategy;Development of Research, Technology, Training and Knowledge Management;Regional and International Engagement and Participation;Promotion of Consultative Processes and Communication to Improve Public Participation in Mitigation and Adaptation Response Measures;Strengthening Climate Change Governance Arrangements;Development and incorporation of mechanisms and tools to mainstream climate change into ecosystem protection and land-use and physical planning The implementation of the Framework is to be overseen and supported by the Ministry of Water, Land, Environment and Climate Change (MWLECC). In the short-term, the Climate Change Division (CCD) within the MWLECC, has the administrative oversight and responsibility for climate change initiatives. In the medium term, a Climate Change Department is to be established. A Climate Change Focal Point Network is also to be established, composed of focal points appointed in all ministries, selected departments and agencies, and representatives of civil society and private groups. The MWLECC is to present to Cabinet an annual report on measures that have been undertaken to implement this Policy Framework and, after five years, the Policy Framework should be publicly reviewed. The Policy Framework also identifies a number of Special Initiatives for early implementation: Special Initiative for Water Resources ManagementSpecial Initiative for Low Carbon DevelopmentSpecial Initiative for Disaster Risk FinancingSpecial Initiative for Ecosystem ProtectionSpecial Initiative for Land Use PlanningSpecial Initiative for Communication",JAM,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbjhNIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--1948ac272e274ab45b8c956916f5b9c56c30b8b6/Jamaica-Climate-Change-Policy-fwL-2015.pdf|en,executive,01/09/2015|Law passed||,Economy-wide;Social development;Transportation,"Capacity building|Governance;Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;International cooperation|Governance;Education, training and knowledge dissemination|Information",Adaptation;Mitigation,Adaptation,,Framework,2015,English,Adaptation;Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Redd+ And Lulucf,,

The Act elaborates the responsibilities of the Ministry of Energy for renewables, which include the development of a national strategy of research in this field and creation of an Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), to be in charge the production, distribution, supply and use of renewable energy.

The Energy Management regulations of 2012 establishes that a commission shall carry out energy consumption rating for all facilities, mandates owner occupier of large facilities to appoint an energy officer and develop an energy management policy that outlines measures of efficiency and conservation, mandates submission of energy audit reports, develop an energy investment plan and demonstrate its implementation in a phased manner.

The Energy (Solar Water Heating) Regulations 2012 were made under section 110 of the Energy Act, 2006. They require all premises with hot water requirements exceeding 100 litres/day to install and use solar heating systems. Violation of the provisions can result in fines (up to 1 million shillings) or imprisonment (up to 1 year) or both.

By identifying tangible, on-the-ground actions for resilience and measures that enable the Government to facilitate these, the plan will guide the implementation of these complementary policies in an integrated approach. The government hopes that such a systematic approach will maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of existing capacities and resources as well as ensuring the success of new initiatives. The specific goals of the policy are: 1) strengthening good governance, policies, strategies and legislation, 2) improving knowledge and information generation, management and sharing, 3) strengthening and greening the private sector, including small-scale business, 4) increasing water and food security with integrated and sector-specific approaches and promoting healthy and resilient ecosystems, 5) strengthening health service delivery to address climate change impacts, 6) promoting sound and reliable infrastructure development and land management, 7) delivering appropriate education, training and awareness programs, 8) increasing effectiveness and efficiency of early warnings and disaster and emergency management, 9) promoting the use of sustainable, renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency, 10) strengthening capacity to access finance, monitor expenditures and maintain strong partnerships, 11) maintaining the existing sovereignty and unique identity of Kiribati, and 12) enhancing the participation and resilience of vulnerable groups. The document further examines administrative and governance factors, as well as financial resources needed for implementing such an approach. ",KIR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBc2tNIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--11c3efb7f290627c67fd2bd9a9ff8377acbf03cf/2019%20Kiribati-Joint-Implementation-Plan-for-Climate-Change-and-Disaster-Risk-Management-2019-2028.pdf|en,executive,25/12/2014|Law passed||;01/01/2019|Approved||,Energy;Health;LULUCF;Transportation;Water,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",Adaptation;Drm/Drr,Adaptation;Disaster Risk Management;Loss And Damage,Cyclones;Tsunamis;Storms;Hurricanes;Soil Erosion;Sea Level Rise,Plan,2019,English,Adaptation;Energy Supply;Energy Demand,,
8869.0,National Water Resources Policy,"Kiribati's National Water Resources Policy and Implementation Plan deals first and foremost with the impacts of climate change on water supply. It outlines three concrete policy goals, as well as seven, more specific policy objectives.

The goals are to (1) provide safe, socially equitable, financially, technically and environmentally sustainable water supplies to enhance the welfare and livelihood of I-Kiribati, (2) Protect and conserve freshwater sources for public water supplies, and (3) Deliver freshwater efficiently and effectively.

The objectives are to (1) increase access to safe and reliable water supplies, (2) achieve sustainable water resource management, (3) improve understanding and monitoring of water resources and their use, (4) improve protection of public freshwater sources, (5) increase community awareness of and participation in the protection, management and conservation of water, (6) improve governance in the water sector, and (7) decrease unaccounted for water losses, improve cost recovery and find alternate sources of water.

The policy places special emphasis on climate change in sustainable water use management. It states that the government intends to sustainably manage water and sanitation services ""during climatic extremes,"" such as droughts, heavy rains, and storm surges, all of which can decrease quality and quantity of water supply.

The implementation plan defines the priority actions and sector-specific strategies for implementing the policy. Importantly, it also assigns those actions to specific actors in government.",KIR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcWdGIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--8d01c59770e4d8cd2567ffd9bbd63a766f7680ff/f|,executive,01/11/2008|Law passed,Health;Water,,,Adaptation,,Policy,2008,English,Adaptation,,

General objectives are: reducing poverty to minimal levels; becoming a middle-income country; becoming a newly industrialised country; and consolidating democracy and enhancing national unity. It was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development.

Climate change is identified in Vision 2035 as one of the two major challenges to Cameroon's economy. Over exploitation of natural resources and environmental costs have been warned as it results in climate change threats; Cameroon is partly located in Sahel area with existing harmful effects of climate change: desert encroachment, increased temperatures, irregular seasons, sea level rise, floods, volcanism, landslides rock fall and toxic fumes. The document calls for reduction of greenhouse gases to tackle climate change as a key regional strategy for Cameroon. The Government of Cameroon pledges to seek high growth level while achieving Millennium Development Goals.

Under the tentative implementation schedule of Vision 2035, drafting and implementation of major environmental policy to fight against the climate change impact is planned for the phase one (2010-2019). Climate change control is listed as one of the three specific objectives for the phase two (2020-2027).

10087.0,The 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China and Outline of the Vision for 2035,"The 14th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2021-2025 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. Like previous five-year plans, the 14th Five Year plan sets out the direction of travel for China’s climate action over the period 2021 - 2025. It also contains references to the long-term direction of travel until 2035. The plan was released and ratified by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. The plan reiterates the previously announced target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and sets a goal of seeing emissions peak in 2030. The most critical provision in the plan concerning climate is Article XXVIII, which contains a section entitled ‘Actively respond to climate change”, but various other provisions also touch on climate issues.  Relevant provisions are summarised below: Article III: Main Goals Section 1 of Article 3 sets out China’s long-term goals until 2035. It includes an emphasis on “green modes of production” and notes that “carbon emissions will decline steadily after reaching a peak”. More detailed objectives are set out in Section 2, which reads: “Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5% and 18% respectively, total emissions of the main pollutants will continue to fall, and the rate of forest coverage will increase to 24.1%.

10087.0,Outline of the People's Republic of China 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives for 2035,"The 14th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2021-2025 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. Like previous five-year plans, the 14th Five Year plan sets out the direction of travel for China’s climate action over the period 2021 - 2025. It also contains references to the long-term direction of travel until 2035. The plan was released and ratified by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. The plan reiterates the previously announced target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and sets a goal of seeing emissions peak in 2030. The most critical provision in the plan concerning climate is Article XXVIII, which contains a section entitled ‘Actively respond to climate change”, but various other provisions also touch on climate issues.  Relevant provisions are summarised below: Article III: Main Goals Section 1 of Article 3 sets out China’s long-term goals until 2035. It includes an emphasis on “green modes of production” and notes that “carbon emissions will decline steadily after reaching a peak”. More detailed objectives are set out in Section 2, which reads: “Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5% and 18% respectively, total emissions of the main pollutants will continue to fall, and the rate of forest coverage will increase to 24.1%. The ecological environment will continue to improve, ecological safety barriers will be made more secure, and urban and rural living environments will be significantly improved.” Article IX: Develop and expand strategic emerging industries Article 9 emphasises the need to seize opportunities for ecosystem driven development and includes provisions on bioenergy.  Article XI Build a modern infrastructure system This article includes plans to develop low-carbon, clean energy, with a focus on wind, hydro and nuclear, referred to as a “modern energy system”.

10332.0,Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking before 2030,"This Action Plan aims to enable carbon dioxide peaking by 2030 and ultimately achieve carbon neutrality. It covers the 14th and 15th five-year plan periods. It seeks to strengthen the government's ability to mobilise the nation as a whole and involve the private sector into the decarbonisation efforts. It highlights 1) the promotion of innovation in green and low-carbon science and technology, 2) institutional reform in energy and other relevant fields, 3) the development of incentives and constraint mechanisms, and 4) the need to ""avoid excessive side effects"" of decarbonisation policies, so as to maintain energy security and economic development as the bottom line. The plan also calls for stimulating international cooperation, notably through 1) global climate governance, 2) green cooperation on business, technology, and finance, and 3) making Belt and Road Initiative green.The Action Plan further seeks to enhance policy support by developing  a unified and standardised carbon emissions measuring and counting system; improve laws, regulations and standards; optimise economic policies; and establish further market mechanisms. It should be implemented through a strengthening of planning and coordination efforts, ensuring that responsibilities are taken at all levels, and develop a strict oversight and assessment system.The document lists a series of sectoral policy goals which are as following.Energy demand and supply:Promote coal substitution as well as transformation and upgrading. The document mandates to ""strictly control the scale of supplementary coal power"" and of coal consumption growth.Develop wind, solar and hydropower according to local context.Develop nuclear power through a safe and orderly approach Rationally regulating oil and gas consumption. The plan notably promotes alternatives like advanced liquid biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, the use of liquid natural gas for peak shaving power stations and as fuel for vehicles and ships.Speed up the development of the new electric power system.Raise capacity for managing energy conservation across the board.

8588.0,"Law n ° 2019-1270 of December 2, 2019 of amending finance for 2019 (1)","French budget laws introduces a number of climate-related clauses, notably relating to the taxation system. Nota Bene: the figures below are representative of original changes and might have changed with more recent versions of the finance law.Carbon taxation: The budget law sets a trajectory for the carbon component of domestic consumption tax rates for the 2018-2022 period, with a more ambitious objective than that set by the law on the energy transition. Thus, the value of the carbon component of the tariffs for these taxes is set at 44.60 euros / tonne of CO2 in 2018 (instead of 39 euros initially), 55 euros in 2019 (against 47.5 euros) and 65, 40 euros in 2020 (against 56 euros), to reach 86.20 euros in 2022. In addition, it is expected in the new tariffs of TICPE (domestic consumption tax on energy products) a convergence of the tariff of diesel towards the gasoline tariffs in four years, ie by 2021. This measure leads to an increase in the fixed portion of the TICPE applicable to road diesel by € 2.6 per hectolitre per year for four years, which is in addition to that of the carbon portion programmed for the period 2018-2022. Used vehicles: The rate of the additional tax on the tax on the registration certificates of used vehicles has been tightened. The objective is to encourage buyers to equip themselves with less polluting vehicles.  Reinforcement of the ecological penalty on cars: The environmental penalty for automobiles has changed with successive finance laws. It remains based on the only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of vehicles without taking into account their pollutant emissions (fine particles, nitrogen oxides ...) but the trigger threshold of the malus has been lowered, originally from 127 to 120 grams of CO2 / km. The law set a progressive scale ranging from 50 euros for the least emitting vehicles to 10,500 euros for those emitting 185 g of CO2 / km or more.The finance law for 2022 further lowers the thresholds, increases the penalties and introduces a mass tax in working order (weight penalty) from January 1st, 2022. The tax on the mass in running order of the vehicle is set at € 10 per kg from 1,800 kg. The tax does not apply to vehicles used to transport persons suffering from disabilities and low-emissions vehicles. There are other exemptions, notably related to family size.   Premium conversion to electric vehicles: EUR 388 million has been earmarked in the budget of the special purpose account Aid for the acquisition of clean vehicles to finance aid for the acquisition of clean vehicles (EUR 266 million) and the withdrawal of vehicles more pollutants (€ 122 million).  Electric bicycles: Faced with the bronca caused by the decision not to maintain beyond 31 January 2018 the bonus for the purchase of an electric-assisted bicycle (e-bike), State aid was finally extended by 5 millions of euros. It is however conditional on the payment of aid by a local authority and refocused on the most modest households.  Energy transition tax credit (ISCED): The law of finance extends it for the year 2018 but hardens its conditions. As regards oil boilers, the eligibility criteria have been strengthened. The worst performers were excluded from ISCED as of January 1, 2018. In contrast, the eligibility of those meeting enhanced energy performance criteria, defined by decree, will be maintained until June 30, 2018 at a rate of 15%. The eligibility of glazed windows is maintained at a rate of 15%, only for taxpayers replacing single glazing with double glazing, until June 30, 2018.

The NCCS is structured as following: framework for the elaboration of the climate strategy; mitigation of climate change; adaptation to the changing climate; and implementation of the strategy. The reduction target for 2025 is reduction by 16% to 25% from the 1990 level in case of a unilateral 20% reduction by the EU, or 27% to 34% from the 1990 level in case of a conditional target reduction of 30% by the EU.

Monitoring is applicable to NCCS and also the NCCP, which is to be prepared by a set of indexes that reflect the climate change efficiency of the economy or the carbon reduction (e.g. GHG emission per GDP, emission per capita, energy intensity).

The NCCS identifies three major directions of actions for the long term climate change policy: to comply with EU and international requirements in order to reduce GHG emissions by reducing overall energy use; to fight against the unfavourable ecological and socio-economic effects of the inevitable climate change and improve adaptability to climate change impacts; and to raise social awareness of climate change.

1449.0,General Law on Climate Change,"The approval of the GLCC gives certainty and continuity to climate policy in Mexico and sets the country on a path to a low carbon economy. It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000. The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities. Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios. The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes. The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner. The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law. The law was amended in 2014 to establish a tax on fossil fuels, and in 2016 at article 94 to frame a carbon market. Attached regulation sets the framework for the accounting of carbon emissions.

1449.0,General Law Of Climate Change,"The approval of the GLCC gives certainty and continuity to climate policy in Mexico and sets the country on a path to a low carbon economy. It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000. The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities. Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios. The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes. The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner. The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law. The law was amended in 2014 to establish a tax on fossil fuels, and in 2016 at article 94 to frame a carbon market. Attached regulation sets the framework for the accounting of carbon emissions.

2023.0,Law on renewable energies,"This law provides a legal framework for the development of renewable energy projects in Morocco. These are defined as all sources of energy that are naturally renewable, particularly solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, wave and tidal energy, as well as energy generated through biomass, waste and biogas (but excluding hydraulic energy with installed power above 30MW). The law prioritises the development of renewable sources in order to promote energy security, access to energy, sustainable development, reduction of GHG emissions, reduction of deforestation, and integration/harmonisation of Morocco's renewable energy production with other Euro-Mediterranean markets.
Originally passed in 2010, the latest version from December 2015, introduces a net metering scheme for solar and wind power plants connected to the high-voltage grid, and in the future also those connected at the middle and low-voltage level. In particular, the law calls for regulation detailing the conditions for investors in solar-PV to benefit from opening of the low-voltage grid to renewable power installations. Private investors in renewable power in general will be able to sell their surplus output to the grid, but no more than 20 per cent of their annual production. The exact terms and conditions of the net metering scheme will be set by regulation.
The law further regulates the electricity sector and creates an authorisation/declaration system, depending on the capacity of the facility: a declaration is required if an electricity generating facility capacity is between 20kW and 2MW; an authorisation is required if an electricity generating facility capacity is equal to or higher than 2MW. In respect of facilities that produce thermal energy, there is only a declaration if the capacity is equal to or higher than 8MW. It also allows the supply and export of the electricity produced to the local market and/or through the national grid and interconnections with other countries.",MAR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaE1JIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ba0c0e366a69fdda323a979163b17d7c5abf67d2/f|,legislative,11/02/2010|Law passed||;21/04/2011|Regulation issued||;01/12/2015|Amended||,Energy;LULUCF;Waste,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Law,2010,French,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Renewables,,

9435.0,Decree-Law No. 85/2019,"This resolution approves the Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality of the Portuguese Economy in 2050. This Strategy also constitutes the document being sent to the UNFCCC according to Portugal's international commitments. The document materialises the government's 2016 pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the period. The strategy explores the feasibility of trajectories that lead to carbon neutrality, identifies the main vectors of decarbonisation and estimates the reduction potential of the various sectors of the national economy, such as energy and industry, mobility and transport , agriculture, forests and other land uses, and waste and wastewater.The resolution sets as an objective, for the purposes of the previous number, the reduction of GHG emissions for Portugal between 85% and 90% by 2050, compared to 2005, and the compensation of the remaining emissions through the use of soil and forests, to be achieved through a emission reduction trajectory between 45% and 55% by 2030, and between 65% and 75% by 2040, in relation to 2005.The document details the following vectors of decarbonisation:a) Decarbonise the production of electricity, eliminating the production of electricity from coal by 2030 and proceeding with the total decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050, betting on endogenous renewable resources;b) Implement the energy transition, significantly increasing energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, investing in the incorporation of endogenous renewable energy sources in final energy consumption, promoting electrification and adjusting the role of natural gas in the national energy system;c) Progressively decentralize and democratize energy production, giving emphasis to the role of the consumer as an active part of the energy system;d) Promote decarbonisation in the residential sector, favoring urban rehabilitation and increasing energy efficiency in buildings, promoting progressive electrification of the sector and the use of more efficient equipment, and combating energy poverty;e) Decarbonise mobility, favoring the mobility system in public transport, through its strengthening and decarbonization of fleets, supporting innovative and intelligent solutions for multimodal, active, shared and sustainable mobility, as well as electric mobility and other technologies zero emissions, together with a reduction in the carbon intensity of sea and air transport, focusing on innovation, efficiency and cleaner, renewable fuels, as well as the decarbonisation of short- and long-distance transport of goods, promoting a logistical chain with a modal split that minimizes the carbon and energy intensity of the transport system, reaffirming the role of maritime and fluvial transport in conjunction with rail freight;f) Promote the energy transition in industry, the incorporation of low carbon production processes and industrial symbiosis, promoting innovation and competitiveness;g) Betting on sustainable agriculture, through the significant expansion of conservation agriculture and precision agriculture, substantially reducing emissions associated with livestock and the use of fertilizers and promoting innovation;h) Foster carbon sequestration, through active agricultural and forest management, promoting the valorization of the territory;i) Changing the paradigm of using resources in production and consumption, abandoning the linear economic model and moving to a circular and low carbon economic model;j) Prevent the production of waste, increase recycling rates and very significantly reduce the deposition of waste in landfills;k) Streamline the participation of cities and local administrations in decarbonisation, encouraging an integrated approach to its different vectors, in particular mobility, buildings, services and waste management, and enhancing the role they have been playing in mitigating climate change;l) Stimulating research, innovation and knowledge production for neutrality in the various sectors of activity;m) Make taxation an instrument for the transition to neutrality, proceeding with the elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies, reinforcing the application of the carbon tax and promoting greater taxation on the use of resources, recycling revenues for decarbonization and fair transition ;n) Redirect financial flows to promote carbon neutrality, namely by promoting the development of a favorable framework for sustainable financing and greater involvement of the financial system, as well as the respective monitoring;o) Promote the involvement of society in the transition, contributing to increase individual and collective action, the adoption of sustainable behaviors and the alteration of production and consumption patterns in favor of sustainability, namely through environmental education and awareness;p) Promote the development of skills and (re) qualification directed towards new opportunities for economic development;q) Encourage the development of the new economy linked to energy transition and decarbonisation, supporting the development of new industrial and service clusters, and the generation of new business opportunities;r) Promote a fair and cohesive transition, which values ​​the

It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG.

1506.0,Electricity Act 1998,"The Electricity Act (E-Act) 1998 is an important basis for the creation of the electricity market in the Netherlands. By establishing this market, producers and suppliers of electricity were able to offer electricity on a market.

On April 9, 2018, the Energy Transition Act (wet VET) was adopted to amend the 1998 document and the Gas Act. The objective of this Act is to make the uptake of renewable energies in the country easier by reviewing extensively and in much detail the previous legal framework.

The Act allowed for distribution companies and large consumers could buy electricity from generators other than the local one. While the Act limited large-scale production to the existing generators, it also allowed self-generation by industry and CHP production by industrial firms or by joint ventures involving distribution companies. The Act forced distribution companies to take in all electricity that was locally generated and supplied to them, and to pay a feed-in tariff essentially equal to the avoided costs.

The E-Act also established, as of August 1, 1998, DTe, the independent regulator for the energy sector, as a chamber of the Dutch competition authority NMa. DTe was charged with supervising the sector and had the responsibility to guarantee non-discriminatory access to the grid for generators and to regulate the prices of the captive end users. The law forced energy companies to split their tariffs into network tariffs (including systems services) and tariffs for energy use as of the year 2000. DTe regulated the network tariffs and the final tariffs of the captive users, with the law imposing an RPI-X formula and the '1996=2000 principle' stating that overall prices in the year 2000 could not be higher than those that prevailed in 1996.

As of 1 April 2014, the regulation for the feed-in tariff (SDE+) for 2014 has opened. This regulation includes the following features: a budget ceiling is established for all types of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and hydro phased opening a ‘free category' to enhance investments in certain technologies; feed-in tariff granted for a certain period (5, 12 or 15 years); a maximum subsidy amount for the Netherlands, to be determined annually (EUR3.5bn, USD5.4bn in 2014).

1513.0,Climate Change Response Act 2002,"The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.  The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.",NZL,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcGtHIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a085e5c6e37040e3f55851174c5b0d3c101b8028/f|en,legislative,18/11/2002|Law passed||;25/12/2014|Last amendment||;01/11/2019|Amended by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act||;22/06/2020|Amended by the Emissions Trading Reform Act||,Agriculture;Economy-wide;LULUCF;Transportation;Waste,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Tax incentives|Economic;Capacity building|Governance;Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;MRV|Governance",Mitigation,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Act,2002,English,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Carbon Pricing;Redd+ And Lulucf,,

It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times. The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.  The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.  The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.  The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.  The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.",NZL,https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0022/latest/whole.html#LMS143384|en,legislative,18/11/2002|Law passed||;25/12/2014|Last amendment||;01/11/2019|Amended by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act||;22/06/2020|Amended by the Emissions Trading Reform Act||,Agriculture;Economy-wide;LULUCF;Transportation;Waste,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Tax incentives|Economic;Capacity building|Governance;Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;MRV|Governance",Mitigation,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Act,2020,English,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Carbon Pricing;Redd+ And Lulucf,,

- to strengthen the scientific research system necessary to developing biofuels
- to educate workers about innovative fuel technologies
- to incentivise the application of biofuel technologies
- to incentivise private capital investment in biofuel production
- to incentivise the commercialisation of biofuels
- to promote the production of biofuels in rainforest regions within the framework of sustainable development

The Law outlines co-ordination with anti-drug programmes, so that national and interna-tional funds designated to The War on Drugs are used to incentivise farmers to cultivate crops designated for biofuels rather than production of coca plants.

2054.0,Supreme Decree No. 011-2015-MINAM: They approve the national strategy against climate change,"The National Strategy on Climate Change (ENCC) 2015 updates and replaces the ENCC originally adopted in 2003. It reflects the commitment of the Peruvian State to take action on climate change in an integrated, cross-cutting and multi-sectoral manner, aiming to fulfil the ""Vision for 2021"", when ""Peru will have adapted to the adverse effects of and taken advantage of the opportunities posed by climate change, laying the foundation for sustainable low carbon development"".

The Strategy identifies key climate risks for the country, such as glacial retreat and reduced access to the associated water resources, unusual variation of temperatures on land and in the sea, changing historical patterns of rainfall, rising sea levels, and the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. It also assesses the distribution of GHG emissions throughout the Peruvian economy.

Based on the two above assessments, the ENCC sets two key objectives, each with 4 associated indicators :



Prevent the adverse impacts of climate change from reducing the vulnerability of the economy and society to such impacts, raising awareness among the population and implementing adaptation actions in appropriate scale. The associated indicators are:



Increased proportion of people who know what actions to take to manage climate change risks and adapt to the impacts







Increased volume of private investment and increased quality of public expenditure for climate change adaptation







Reduced human and economic losses due to the occurrence of natural disasters linked to climate change







Increased production of scientific research and technological development as a basis and guide for climate change risk management and adaptation to climate change













Reduce GHG emissions, while taking advantage of the opportunities associated productive transformation in key sectors such as forestry, energy, transportation, industrial and solid waste management.



Reduced and continuously decreasing carbon intensity of the economy







Reduction of GHG emissions in all sectors, especially carbon intensive sectors







Increased carbon sequestration and net reduction of emissions in the forestry sector

2054.0,National Strategy against Climate Change 2015,"The National Strategy on Climate Change (ENCC) 2015 updates and replaces the ENCC originally adopted in 2003. It reflects the commitment of the Peruvian State to take action on climate change in an integrated, cross-cutting and multi-sectoral manner, aiming to fulfil the ""Vision for 2021"", when ""Peru will have adapted to the adverse effects of and taken advantage of the opportunities posed by climate change, laying the foundation for sustainable low carbon development"".

The Strategy identifies key climate risks for the country, such as glacial retreat and reduced access to the associated water resources, unusual variation of temperatures on land and in the sea, changing historical patterns of rainfall, rising sea levels, and the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. It also assesses the distribution of GHG emissions throughout the Peruvian economy.

Based on the two above assessments, the ENCC sets two key objectives, each with 4 associated indicators :



Prevent the adverse impacts of climate change from reducing the vulnerability of the economy and society to such impacts, raising awareness among the population and implementing adaptation actions in appropriate scale. The associated indicators are:



Increased proportion of people who know what actions to take to manage climate change risks and adapt to the impacts







Increased volume of private investment and increased quality of public expenditure for climate change adaptation







Reduced human and economic losses due to the occurrence of natural disasters linked to climate change







Increased production of scientific research and technological development as a basis and guide for climate change risk management and adaptation to climate change













Reduce GHG emissions, while taking advantage of the opportunities associated productive transformation in key sectors such as forestry, energy, transportation, industrial and solid waste management.



Reduced and continuously decreasing carbon intensity of the economy







Reduction of GHG emissions in all sectors, especially carbon intensive sectors







Increased carbon sequestration and net reduction of emissions in the forestry sector











The ENCC mandates the production of sectoral and sub-national action plans, setting specific targets and detailing measures necessary to achieve the objectives proposed in ENCC. These are to be monitored and evaluated by the National Commission on Climate Change.

2010.0,Act on renewable energy sources,"This Act defines the new regime for support to renewable energy sources (including wind energy, energy radiation of the sun, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal energy, hydropower, waves, currents error and tidal energy obtained from biomass, biogas, agricultural biogas and bioliquid - art. 2.22), aiming to stabilise the long-term support system, with the goal to prevent electricity prices form increasing in an uncontrolled manner. The Act also transposes the Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy into Polish legislation and aims to contribute to Poland's target of reaching 15% share of renewable energy production by 2020. The Act will provide continuing support to most existing installations (in operation by or before 31 December 2015) through certificates of origin, while future investments will compete for support through an auction system organised by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO). The auctions, applying to new installations over 10 kW of installed capacity, will be based on a type of contract-for-difference (CfD) granted, with separate auctions for old and new plants and for plants of 1 MW or less, as well as varied reference prices for the eighteen renewable sources reference groups. The chosen renewable plants will have to start generation within 24 months (solar plants), 72 months (wind plants) or 48 months (others), and they will be required to deliver at least 85% of the volume offered in the bid, under threat of penalty. The energy auctioned will be bought by the newly formed state-owned entity Operator Rozlicze? Energii Odnawialnej (for energy produced in installations above 500kW) or by electricity distribution companies (for energy produced in installations up to 500kW). Most existing installations will also be eligible to change to the auction support instrument from the current certificates of origin, except for hydropower plants over 5 MW, non-qualified biomass co-firing installations (art. 44) and biomass installations exceeding 50 MW of electrical power (or 150 MW of CHP power). The existing installations will continue to be eligible for the existing system of support through certificates of origin (introduced through the 1997 Energy Law), but a number of limits will apply: support for max 15 years from the start of renewable energy production in the given installation;support for hydropower of max 5 MW of capacity;support for biomass co-firing installations of less than 150 MW capacity capped to equivalent of the average generation over 2011-2013;large consumers (over 100 GWh of electricity consumed annually) and commodity brokerage houses are required to obtain certificates of origin for 14% and 15% of their annual electricity consumption for 2015 and 2016 respectively or pay the substitution fee. From 2017 the share is min 20%, but can be reduced by the Minister of Economy, if necessary due to specific market conditions. A unit substitution fee is set to a constant 300.03 PLN/MWh (2014 level, approx. 72 €/MWh), which should stabilise the price of certificates, as purchasing and redeeming of certificates of origin will only be allowed if the average market price of certificates remains below 75% of the substitution fee.The Act also introduces a feed-in tariff system for micro installations of up to 10 kW (max 40 kW under special conditions - art. 41.7), while guaranteeing purchase by electricity distribution companies at 100% of market price for the next 15 years, until no later than December 31, 2035 (art. 41.5). The support also covers the so-called ‘prosumers,' who both produce and consume their own electricity. The subsidies amount to PLN 0.75 (EUR 0.18) per kWh to prosumers with a capacity of up to 3 kW (hydropower, wind, solar), and PLN 0.40-0.70 (EUR 0.10-0.17) for those with a capacity between 3 and 10 kW (biogas, hydropower, wind, solar). Moreover, there are no licensing/concession requirements for those micro generators that do not have active business.

The 2015 update also enlarges the list of 'renewable sources' to include wave energy, ocean currents energy and biofuels, and it expands the support of the Programme and Fund to hydropower plants with capacity up to 50 MW (up from original 30 MW).This law was amended several times, notably by law 27191 and by a number of resolutions including resolution 285/2018 and resolution 742/2021.The market regime for the production of renewable energy is regulated by resolution 281/2017 and amending resolution 551/2021. ",ARG,https://www.argentina.gob.ar/normativa/nacional/decreto-531-2016-259883|es,legislative,02/01/2007|Law passed||;15/10/2015|Amended by law 27191||;03/08/2021|Amended by resolution 742/2021||,Energy,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Tax incentives|Economic;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Decree,2016,Spanish,Research And Development;Energy Supply,,

The plan further encourages industrial users to increase their average consumption of ethanol by 11% in the next 10 years; brings forward the 5% biodiesel blending requirement from 2013 to 2010; and supports the creation of an international biofuels market. The Plan determines that a National Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be created to reduce electricity consumption by 10% by 2030 and to establish other measures such as incentives to replace old electric equipment with modern equipment, and create improvements in industry energy efficiency, transportation and buildings. The Plan promotes a sustainable increase in the use of biofuels in the national transportation network and establishes measures on adaptation to climate change. The plan establishes that actions should be taken to eliminate the loss of national forest cover by 2015. The plan sets targets for a consistent cut on deforestation to be accomplished in subsequent four-year periods. The goal is to reduce deforestation by 40% in the 2006-2009 period in relation to the Amazon Fund's 10-year reference period (1996-2005).

The strategy, in turn, consists of a set of recommendations and guidelines to be followed in defining the actions and initiatives to be implemented throughout the 2050 horizon. These, in turn, need to be defined in an Action Plan to be prepared following the approval of the PNE 2050. The document notably prioritises the expansion of hydropower capacity, of oil and gas production, the analysis of promotion mechanisms for a range of renewables, research and development, and increased efficiency.The PNE 2030 is the first study of integrated planning of energy resources held within the Brazilian government, and prepared by the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil (MME). It proposes a strategic direction for expansion of energy supply. Its estimate of future electricity needs is based on a forecast percentage growth in demand per annum corresponding to an average GDP growth per annum. The PNE is composed of a series of studies that seek to provide inputs to formulate energy policies according to an integrated view of available resources. As a contribution to meeting that future estimated demand, the MME proposes 164GW as the country's ‘exploitable, but as yet unrealised' hydropower ‘potential'. Of that 164GW, the MME says that 90% (about 147GW) is in the Amazon region. If realised, this figure would amount to more than a doubling of the total installed national electricity generation capacity in Brazil - 121GW in 2012 (from all generation sources). The PNE provides for the expansion of the electricity sector by 2030 with the use of energy sources: (1) Renewables - 191.35GW (92GW existed in 2010), (2) Conventional thermoelectric - 21.5GW (16GW existed in2010), and (3) Nuclear- 8GW (2GW existed in 2010).

It was adopted by the European Council in October 2014 as a strategic document, although binding legislation is yet to be drafted. It includes the binding 2030 EU domestic GHG reduction target of at least 40% compared to 1990, as well as a target of at least 27% for final renewable energy, and a at least 27% for energy savings by 2030 (target to be reviewed upwards to 30% in 2020). In addition, the EU ETS is to be reformed and strengthened. To achieve the 2030 binding 40% reduction target, the sectors covered by the EU ETS would have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005. In parallel, emissions from non-EU ETS sectors would need to be cut by 30% below the 2005 level, through national measures. To address the surplus of emission allowances in the EU ETS and to improve the system's resilience, a market stability reserve is to be established and the annual factor to reduce the cap on the maximum permitted emissions is to be changed from the current 1.74% to 2.2% from 2021. The volume of free allowances is to be reduced progressively; Member States with a GDP per capita below 60% of the EU average may opt to continue to give free allowances to the energy sector up to 2030, but the maximum amount handed out for free after 2020 should be no more than 40% of the allowances allocated to eligible Member States. The 2030 Framework stresses the importance of a fully functioning and connected EU energy market, as foreseen in the European Energy Security Strategy (2014).

A consumer's body authorised by the Cabinet of Ministers issues a document confirming the purchase of energy generated from alternative energy sources. It also establishes that the wholesale electricity market must buy the green tariff electricity from alternative energy sources, and sell it directly to consumers or energy supplying companies.  Green tariff is defined as a special tariff for electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy (except blast-furnace and coke gases; with regard to hydropower - at small plants only, i.e. with capacity up to 10 MWel).  The amended Law obliges the Ukrainian wholesale electricity providers to purchase electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy through the green tariff. The green tariff was planned as a double average tariff for traditional electricity sold on the Ukrainian wholesale market in the year preceding the year of the tariff decision.  The state regulator (NKRE) defines the Green Tariff based on a formula. Special fed-in (green) tariffs were established for wind, solar, biomass, biogas, small hydro (<10MW) and geothermal power plants. Green Tariffs are fixed until 2030 with guaranteed electricity of-take by the Wholesale Electricity Market Operator. Green Tariffs are revised on a monthly basis to follow changes in UAH/EUR currency exchange rate.

1755.0,Climate Change Act 2008,"The Act provides a long-term framework to improve carbon management, to help the transition to a low carbon economy, encourage investment in low carbon goods and provide an international signal. The Act establishes a legally binding target for the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It also creates 5-yearly 'carbon budgets' as a pathway to meet the long-term target. The Act has now established a legally binding target of at least an 100% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, to be achieved through action in the UK and abroad. Ministers must report on the policies implemented to meet carbon budgets and produce an annual report to Parliament on the status of UK emissions. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an independent, expert body to advise the government on the level of carbon budgets and on progress in meeting these budgets - submits annual reports to Parliament on progress towards targets and budgets. The government must respond to the reports, ensuring transparency and accountability. The Act sets up a carbon budgeting system that caps emissions over 5-year periods, with three budgets set at a time, to help the UK stay on track for its 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets run from 2008-2012, 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, and were set in law in May 2009. The fourth carbon budget, for 2023-2027 approved by parliament in 2011 and reviewed in 2014, puts into law a target to reduce emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2025 (the midpoint of the budget period). The government must report to Parliament its policies and proposals to meet the budgets and set a limit on the purchase of carbon credits for each budgetary period - for the first budgetary period, a zero limit was set in May 2009, excluding units bought by UK participants in the EU Emissions Trading System. For the second budget period, a limit of 55MtCO2e was set. The Act also gives powers to introduce domestic emissions trading schemes more quickly and easily through secondary legislation - the first use has been to introduce the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. The Act introduced measures on biofuels and powers to introduce pilot financial incentive schemes in England for household waste. The Act requires, by the end of 2012, the inclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions in the net carbon account, or an explanation to Parliament why not. The government announced in December 2012 that this decision would be deferred, recognising uncertainty over the international framework for reducing aviation emissions and particularly the treatment of aviation within the EU ETS. The new net zero target still excludes aviation and shipping. The government must report at least every 5 years on the risks to the UK of climate change, and publish a programme setting out how these will be addressed. The first such climate change risk assessment was published in 2012. The Act also introduces powers for government to require public bodies and statutory undertakers to carry out their own risk assessment and make plans to address those risks. The Act introduces an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, providing advice to, and scrutiny of, the Government's adaptation work. ****** The fifth carbon budget (adopted in June 2016) has set emission reduction levels to 57% compared with 1990 levels. It covers the period between 2028-2032 and is in line with the UK's global commitments.

1765.0,Energy Act 2013,"The Contracts for Difference scheme is the current main mechanism for supporting large-scale generation of renewable electricity. It is a market-based mechanism, designed to provide a substantial incentive for all eligible forms of renewable electricity. CfDs incentivise investment in renewable energy by providing developers of projects with high upfront costs and long lifetimes with direct protection from volatile wholesale prices, and they protect consumers from paying increased support costs when electricity prices are high. The Scheme is administered by the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a private company administered by BEIS.The Contracts for Difference Scheme replaces the Renewables Obligation scheme which was closed to new generating capacity in 2017.The Renewables Obligation (RO) placed an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to source a specified and annually increasing proportion of their electricity sales from renewable sources, or pay a penalty. The obligation for 2009/10 was 9.7%, rising to 15.4% by 2015/6. Previously, one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) was issued for each MWh of eligible generation, regardless of technology. In 2009, reforms gave new generators joining the RO different numbers of ROCs, depending on the costs and potential for large-scale deployment. New projects in more expensive technologies like offshore wind now receive more support and those that are more economic, like landfill gas, receive less. Generators can sell their ROCs to electricity supply companies, which use them to demonstrate compliance with the Obligation. This enabled generators to receive a premium on top of the sale of the electricity. In 2010, changes to the scheme included the end date of the RO being extended to 2037, in order to provide greater long-term certainty for investors, and an increase in support for offshore wind projects meeting certain criteria.  The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the RO.

1783.0,Environmental Management and Conservation Act No.12 of 2002 (Consolidated Edition 2004),"The 2002 Act forms the basis of environmental legislation in Vanuatu andfocuses on four main areas:
- Administration
- Environmental impact assessments
- Biodiversity
- Bio-prospecting laws and community conservation areas (CCAs)

The Amendment Act makes a number of important changes directly relevant to climate change.It includes a definition of climate change ('a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods', page 3), adds the concept of ecosystem services and processes to the Act, and applies the precautionary principle to any decision made regarding the environment that may risk human health or threaten damage to the environment. It also specifies that any decision made under the terms of the Act must be guided by consideration of climate change adaptation and mitigation issues.

The Act requires that the director of the department responsible for the environment must include in their Environmental Registry a climate change database in joint co-ordination with the National Advisory Committee on Climate Change. It also requires that the National State of the Environment Report, published at least once every 10 years, must include a description of national climate change activities, impacts and issues. It requires that climatic considerations and issues be incorporated into any National Policy for the conservation, sustainable development and management of the environment. Further, it specifically identifies climate mitigation as a critical ecosystem service that may be provided by sites of national biodiversity significance and enables the Minister to make any regulations necessary to uphold Vanuatu's obligations under the UNFCCC for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

It establishes an Environmental Trust Fund, funded by penalties and bonds, which is to fund research, environmental rehabilitation, monitoring and analysis, management of community conservation areas, and as required for the protection and conservation of the environment.It also makes several amendments to enforcement provisions, environmental impact assessment procedures, bio-prospecting processes, and details of what constitutes an offence (and the associated punishments) under the 2002 Act.",VUT,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBa1FJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--089018cf4b5b08ccd9dcae23f20d3eafedd88808/f|,legislative,24/01/2011|Law passed,Environment;Health,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Act,2004,English,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development,,

It helps prevent a regulatory vacuum until the complete revision of the CO2 law comes into force. The amendment to the ordinance also aims to implement a requirement of Parliament, namely a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.5% in 2021 compared to 1990. The Swiss people refused the law's full revision in June 2021.The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC.

The version in force and the 2020 Ordinance 641.711 have been amended to cover the period post 1.1.2020. The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are: - Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad - CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met - The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund. - CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations). - If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy - Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects - National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme - Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading - Prepare linking with EU ETS - Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74% - Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year - Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned - The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products - Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars. Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings). The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources. One third of the revenues (and no more than CHF300m USD313.4m) from the CO2 tax and cantonal funds are channelled into the Building programme. Two updates of the programme were necessary as a result of its popularity.

1689.0,Adaptation to climate change in Switzerland,"The Swiss National Adaptation Strategy aims to serve as framework for the federal offices to adapt a co-ordinated course of action in response to adverse climate effects. It is spilt into two parts. The Strategy describes the goals, challenges and fields of action in adapting to climate change in Switzerland. The overall goal of the strategy is to seize the opportunities provided by climate change, to minimise climate change related risks and to improve the adaptive capacity of society, the environment and the economy.  The first part examines the climate change impacts and identifies the most important fields of action of adaptation to climate change in the following sectors: - Natural hazard management - Water management - Agriculture - Forestry - Energy - Tourism - Biodiversity management - Health - Spatial development.  The second part of the strategy is an action plan to reach the strategy's goals. These measures are co-ordinated between the federal offices in order to address the challenges posed by climate change, i.e., effects of heat waves in urban areas, droughts, floods, increasing slope instabilities in the Alps, decreasing snow cover, adverse effects on water, soil and air quality, changes in biodiversity, and the potential spreading of invasive species, vermin and infectious diseases. The adaptation measures need to be carefully aligned with other cross-cutting strategies of the Federal Council.  12 cross-sectoral challenges are identified, including: - Greater heat stress on agglomerations and cities - Increasing levels of summer drought - Greater risk of flooding - Decreasing slope stability and more frequent mass wasting - Rising snowline - Impaired water, soil and air quality - Change in habitats, species, composition and landscapes - Spread of harmful organisms, diseases and alien species.  Co-ordinated approach includes the following: - Working with the cantons, cities and municipalities - In the context of sectoral policies - Cross-collaboration and coordination - International cooperation on adaptation to climate change -International climate negotiations - Adapting to climate change in Europe - Collaboration with neighbouring countries.",CHE,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/laws/1689%20French.pdf|fr,executive,09/04/2014|Law passed,Economy-wide;Energy;Environment;Transportation;Urban;Water,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Zoning & Spatial Planning|Regulation;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;MRV|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",Adaptation,Adaptation,Flood;Drought;Glacial;Floods;Droughts;Landslides;Changes In Air Quality;Changes In Soil Quality;Changes In Average Precipitation;Changes In Surface Water;Change In Air Quality;Heatwaves;Heat Waves;Change In Surface Water;Changes In Average Temperature;Glacial Melting;Change In Soil Quality;Changes In Precipitation;Change In Average Temperature,Strategy,2012,French,Adaptation;Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development,,

Its principal goals include: - ensure production and distribution of economic power, compatible with the requirements of environmental protection - promote the efficient and rational use of energy - encourage the use of indigenous and renewable energy. The Act provides three main targets, to be reached in co-operation with the Cantons, the energy sector and other stakeholders: - The average annual electricity production from renewable sources is to be increased by at least 5,400 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000. Up to 10% of the required target can be met by renewable electricity generation abroad (e.g.CDM). - The average annual hydro-power production is to increase by at least 2,000 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000 - Households' final energy consumption must be stabilised by 2030 at the level it would have had at the entry into force of this provision (2009). Among the measures put forward by the Act to meet the above targets are certification of electricity origin (renewable electricity certificates), preferential installation of new renewable electricity or CHP compared to fossil fuel plants, mandatory offtake for renewable electricity for utilities (conditions apply) with financial support for solar PV plants (30kW max), and energy labelling for buildings, vehicles and appliances.  The Energy Ordinance specifies the provisions of the Energy Act: It includes provisions for a feed-in tariff for electricity from solar PV, wind, hydro (up to 10MW), geothermal and biomass. The payments are made for 10, 20 or 25 years and are differentiated according to application, technology and size of the installation. They only apply to installations built, renovated or expanded after 1 January 2006.

1723.0,Law on the use of renewable energy resources for the production of electrical energy,"This Act (also known as the Renewable Energy Law) encourages the use of renewable energy. This law encompasses the procedures and principles of the conservation of renewable energy resource areas, certification of the energy generated from these sources, and use of these sources.   The measurable objective is to increase the amount of electricity produced by renewable sources by 30% by 2023.  The Act governs the principles for the conservation of renewable resource areas and introduces incentives for domestic energy projects, providing feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable energy sources. The legal entity holding a generation licence is granted a \Renewable Energy Resource Certificate\ (RES Certificate) by the Electricity Markets Regulation Authority (EMRA) to identify and monitor the resource type in purchasing and sale of the electrical energy generated from renewable energy resources in the domestic and international markets.  It creates a broad basis for an emerging domestic renewable energy market. Grid operators are obliged to provide access to the grid for renewable energy generators, and independent power producers can benefit from the feed-in tariff. Holders of energy retail licences are obliged to purchase a percentage of their total uptake from licensed generation companies holding a RES Certificate.  The price of the electricity to be purchased under the Act should be the nationwide average of the electricity wholesale price of the previous year (determined by the EMRA). However a producer can sell the electrical energy generated for a higher price in the market if they are able to.  Some highlights of the law include: - The reduction or cancellation of service fees as an incentive for those willing to build energy generation facilities to meet their own energy consumption needs. - Further incentives are available through a Council of Minister's Decree, such as investments for energy generation facilities, procurement of electro-mechanic systems within the country, research, development and production investments concerning solar energy units, and research and development investments for biomass energy. - Where there are sufficient geothermal energy resources, demand will be primarily met by geothermal and solar thermal energy resources. - In the event that the forests and the lands under private ownership of the Treasury or under the control or disposal of the State are used to generate electricity from renewable energy resources, these areas are leased to or right of way is given to the relevant parties. Any fees required for using this land is reduced by 85%. The law also stipulates that development plans that might have a negative impact on the use and efficiency of renewable energy resource areas can no longer be created on public land.The Act was amended in March 2020 by articles 26 and 27 of law 7226 to enable the Ministry of energy and renewable resources to ease the expropriation of private properties to build renewable capacity. Furthermore, it amends the procedures and principles regarding the evaluation of tariffs applied to support electricity production based on renewable energy sources and other revenues within the scope of the RES Support Mechanism, to grant the Ministry the power to regulate them.The Presidential Decree No.31248 sets out : 1) the prices in Schedule I in the Law will be applied until December 31, 2030 for Renewable Energy Resources (RER) certified production license holders that initiate their operations under the RER support mechanism between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021; 2) if the mechanical and/or electro-mechanical parts used in the RER-certified production facilities that initiate their operations between January 1, 2021 ad June 30, 2021 are manufactued domestically, the prices in Schedule II in the Law will be applied to the prices in Schedule I, for additional five years from the date os operation of the production facility for the electrical energy produced.",TUR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBc3dLIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--082278d03b7ab27b361eb64a9a8dc30eabd81719/1723%20Turkish.pdf|tr,legislative,18/05/2005|Law passed||;29/12/2010|Amended by law 6094||;26/04/2020|Amended by law 7226||;18/09/2020|Approved||,Energy;LULUCF,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation",,Mitigation,,Law,2005,Turkish,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand,,

1004.0,Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan,"The main objective of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan is to expand usage of renewable energies and to diversify energy sources in the country.<br />
<br />
The Plan's renewable energy goals are:<br />
- To install 22,000MW of power generating capacity from renewable sources between 2011 and 2030 (of which 12,000MW for internal usage and 10,000MW for export)<br />
- To meet 20% of electricity generation from renewables by 2030<br />
- For renewable energy development to drive sustainable economic development, to increase energy security supply, and to create jobs<br />
<br />
The plan recognises solar energy a primary renewable technology to be developed, while noting that the potential for wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower energy is comparatively small. The Plan forecasts a 37% increase in total national electricity production by 2030 due to solar electricity production.<br />
<br />
The Development Plan has three stages:<br />
1. 2011 - 2013: pilot projects and testing period for various technologies with a goal to install 110MW of RE power capacity<br />
2. 2014 - 2015: beginning of the deployment programme. Installed RE power capacity to reach 650 MW by the end of this period<br />
3. 2016 - 2020: large scale REs plants deployment. Installed power capacity to reach about 2600 MW the end of this phase<br />
<br />
The Plan aims to increase energy efficiency through a number of avenues:<br />
1. improvement of heat insulation of buildings<br />
2. development of solar water heating; promotion of co-generation<br />
3. promotion of LPG and natural gas fuels<br />
4. developing solar cooling systems<br />

<ul><br />
<li> ""encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources; </li><br />
<li> reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the electricity sector; and</li><br />
<li> ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable"" (Art 3).</li><br />
</ul><br />
These objectives are to be reached through issuing of certificates for the generation of electricity, with two types of renewable energy certificates:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>large?scale generation certificates, created in relation to the generation of electricity by accredited power stations; and</li><br />
<li>small?scale technology certificates, created in relation to the installation of solar water heaters and small generation units (Art 17B).</li><br />
</ul><br />
The certificates can only be issued for eligible renewable energy sources, including hydro, wave, tide, ocean, wind, solar, geothermal?aquifer, hot dry rock, energy crops, wood waste, agricultural waste, waste from processing of agricultural products, food waste, food processing waste, bagasse, black liquor, biomass?based components of municipal solid waste, landfill gas, sewage gas and biomass?based components of sewage, and any other energy source prescribed by the regulations. (Art 17).<br />
Certain purchasers (called liable entities) are required to surrender a specified number of certificates for the electricity that they acquire during a year.<br />
Liable entity is defined as ""a person who, during a year, makes a relevant acquisition (wholesale acquisition or wholesale notional acquisition - <em>author's note</em>) of electricity"" (Art 35). Exemption applies if:<br />
<br />
<ol><br />
<li> ""the electricity was delivered on a grid that has a capacity that is less than 100 MW and that is not, directly or indirectly, connected to a grid that has a capacity of 100 MW or more; or</li><br />
<li> the end user of the electricity generated the electricity and either of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the point at which the electricity is generated is less than 1 km from the point at which the electricity is used; (ii) the electricity is transmitted or distributed between the point of generation and the point of use and the line on which the electricity is transmitted or distributed is used solely for the transmission or distribution of electricity between those 2 points"" (Art 31).</li><br />
</ol><br />
Where a liable entity does not have enough certificates to surrender in a year, it will have to pay renewable energy shortfall charge. There are 2 types of renewable energy shortfall charge:<br />
<br />
<ol><br />
<li>""large?scale generation shortfall charge, which is calculated by reference to a liable entity's relevant acquisitions of electricity, its exemptions, the number of large?scale generation certificates it surrenders and the renewable energy power percentage; and</li><br />
<li>small?scale technology shortfall charge, which is calculated by reference to a liable entity's relevant acquisitions of electricity, its exemptions, the number of small?scale technology certificates it surrenders and the small?scale technology percentage"" (Art 34A).</li><br />

The most recent Commercial Buildings Disclosure Programme, updated over June-September 2016, lowered the mandatory disclosure threshold on commercial office buildings from 2,000 to 1,000 square meters. This should see an additional 1,000 commercial buildings now disclose their energy efficiency when they sell or lease their property and aims to deliver more than $50 million in energy savings, and approximately 3.5 million tonnes of emission reductions over five years. Disclosure changes will commence 1 July 2017.<br />
In relation to lowering the threshold, the frequency of required tenancy lighting assessment was lowered, to every five years instead of each year. This provision entered into effect as of September 1st 2016.<br />

The Plan offers a detailed description of all existing formally approved climate change related measures for each sector (energy, industry, transportation) and cross-cutting issues (awareness-raising, exemplary role of the federal Government, etc.). The National Climate Plan also defines the 11 main axes of Belgium's climate strategy:</div><ul><li>Energy production optimisation</li><li>Efficient use of energy</li><li>Industrial sector initiatives</li><li>Development of sustainable transport</li><li>Prioritisation of sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystems</li><li>Continued efforts in waste management</li><li>Increased climate change research</li><li>Awareness-raising on climate change mitigation options</li><li>Increased direct initiative of public authorities in reducing the GHG emissions</li><li>Use of flexibility mechanisms (JI, CDM)</li><li>Integrating the climate dimension into development aid policy</li></ul><div><br>&nbsp;Climate change policy has been consolidated in the National Climate Plan (2009-2012).

The reform opened up the spot market and guaranteed the right to be connected to the country's power grids to small generating plants, many of which fall into the NCRE category. This move increased commercial and generating opportunities for these small producers.<br />

In addition, the reform exempted projects using NCREs from paying transmission fees, using a differentiated scale—one for plants generating up to 9 MW and another for those generating between 9MW and 20MW.

2040.0,Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution,"This law's purpose is ""protecting and improving the environment, preventing and controlling atmospheric pollution, safeguarding public health, advancing ecological civilization and promoting the sustainable development of economy and society"" (Art 1). It calls for comprehensive measures to be taken against the pollution ""caused by the burning of coal, industrial production, motor vehicles and vessels, dust as well as agricultural activities"" (Art 2.). The objective is to restrict various sources of atmospheric pollutants, including ""air pollutants and greenhouse gases, including particles, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and ammonia etc."" (Art 2.) and make information on atmospheric cleanliness more readily available to the public.<br />
<br />
The 2015 revisions provide that China should promote clean and efficient use of coal, obliging local governments to ban low-quality coal for residential use (Chapter IV, Section 1). Art 32 calls for ""measures to improve energy structure and popularize the production and utilization of clean energy; optimize the utilization of coal to be cleaner and more effective; and reduce the proportion of coal in primary energy consumption and the discharge of atmospheric pollutants during the production, utilization and transformation of coal"".<br />
<br />
The law provides for the Government to advocate low-carbon and eco-friendly transportation. ""The ownership of vehicles using petroleum fuels shall be controlled below an appropriate level in accordance with urban planning. Public transportation in urban areas shall be vigorously boosted to increase its proportion in overall transportation. The State shall adopt measures including fiscal and tax policy and government procurement to popularize motor vehicles and vessels and non-road mobile machineries that save energy, protect the environment and use new energy; to limit motor vehicles and vessels and non-road mobile machineries that feature high level oil consumption and emission; and to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels"" (Art 50). The law calls for establishment of a gasoline quality standard matched with the country's restriction requirements for major pollutants (Art 13), including sulfur, olefin, arenes and benzene.<br />
<br />
The law calls the relevant state environmental department to ""observe and simulate atmospheric conditions and use new technologies of artificial satellites, photogrammetric measurement and long-distance monitoring so as to analyze the sources and future trend of atmospheric pollution in these key areas. The department shall release such analyses to the public"" (Art 91).<br />
<br />
The law also provides greater environmental transparency to the public. It stipulates authorities of the State Council should evaluate provincial-level governments on their attainment of air quality improvement targets. The law also specifies other items to be disclosed publicly, including air quality standard, catalogue of major polluters, contact information of environmental authorities and supervisors, test results on the emissions of new vehicles, and sources and fluctuations of air pollution in important areas (Chapter III).<br />

1817.0,Document CONPES 3700 on the Institutional Strategy for the Articulation of Policies and Actions in Climate Change,"The main objective of CONPES 3700 is to outline a mechanism for institutional co-ordination to incorporate climate change into sectorial and territorial decision making, the National Climate Change System (SISCLIMA).<br />
<br />
CONPES 3700 recommended the creation of SISCLIMA as the official national institution to coordinate and propel climate change actions. Within these actions, SISCLIMA will co-ordinate the implementation of the four climate change priority strategies defined by the government: CCNAP, CLCDS, ENREDD+ and the Strategy for Fiscal Protection Against Natural Disasters. It is expected that these strategies will need to formulate their own financing strategy and to add a component for private sector investment.<br />
<br />
The proposed approach is one whereby climate change initiatives will be built through a bottom-up approach. Four permanent committees at the base of the SISCLIMA structure will coordinate, shape and implement sectoral and territorial policy as well as international affairs for climate change adaptation and mitigation based on detailed technical studies carried out on specialised working groups. The Finance Committee (FC) will act as coordinator of financing activities and offer support to those initiatives seeking financial support by directing efforts to identify and coordinate sources of finance available at the national and international levels. Finally, at the very top of the system, the Inter-Sectoral Commission on Climate Change (COMICC) will bring together various ministries and key national institutions to co-ordinate and direct institutional efforts on climate change and act as the connection point between SISCLIMA and the wider government, including the presidency. COMICC will also share findings and guide policy at the highest level of the national government on climate change issues. The final structure however is still under revision.<br />
<br />
A Presidential Decree is required to give effect to CONPES 3700. At the time of writing (November 2014) this has not been issued and meanwhile successive drafts of the REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) have introduced further refinements. For example, CONPES 3700 envisages that SISCLIMA will be directed by an Executive Committee (COMECC). The latest drafts of the R-PP have sought to make SISCLIMA's governance more inclusive; COMECC has now become an Inter-Sectoral Committee (COMICC).",COL,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaVVJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--090986797d499860502ea5f2eaa58dd869420333/f|,executive,14/07/2011|Law passed,Residential and Commercial;Transportation,"Capacity building|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Adaptation;Disaster Risk Management;Mitigation,,Strategy,,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements,Colombia,

1132.0,Regulations on the Efficient Use of Energy (Law No. 7447),"This law consolidates the participation of the State in the promotion and gradual execution of the programme for the efficient use of energy. It also attempts to establish mechanisms to achieve energy efficiency, taking environmental protection into account.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Ministry for Natural Resources and Energy is responsible for the implementation, monitoring the 'National Programme for the Rational Use of Energy'. To promote this objective, the law establishes the obligation to execute energy efficiency programmes of rational use of energy in companies with high consumption levels. Companies have the legal obligation to report the precise amount of energy they use. When the amount is beyond the maximum level allowed by the Ministry, businesses are notified and have three months to submit a plan to reduce their energy consumption, within six months. The government can, in certain circumstances, provide specific technical recommendations to these companies.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Law calls for the creation of campaigns to raise public awareness on the rational use of energy, including educational programmes in schools. All products must publicly announce their level of energy consumption.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Producers of machines and/or vehicles that use energy (of any source) must obtain authorisation from the Ministry relating to their energy efficiency before beginning production of these goods. The import of similar equipment (including vehicles) is conditional on the submission of energy efficiency data.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The law determines that the Ministry for Natural Resources, Energy and Mining is in charge of determining limits for emissions from vehicles, to be monitored and controlled by the Ministry of Transport.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Additionally, it exempts equipment used for renewable energy from import duties and provides for other tax exemptions (excise tax, ad valorem tax, general sales tax, specific customs tax). Fines and penalties apply upon breaching the law.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Additional legislative and executive regulation specifies mechanisms of support for clean technologies and rational use of energy. Those include an Executive Decree reforming the incentives system for the use of hybrid electrical vehicles; a modification of the law to provide tax exemption for equipment and certain materials, imported as well as produced domestically that contribute to energy savings and rational use; a decree that establishes new rules of the ‘Bandera Azul Ecológica'certification programme for climate-friendly communities and private housing (energy efficiency, low GHG emissions, etc.); and a directive that requires the energy and telecommunications sectors to adopt administrative, financial, legal and technical measuresto ensure citizens' access to cleaner energies at the least possible cost.",CRI,http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/Busqueda/Normativa/Normas/nrm_texto_completo.aspx?param1=NRTC&nValor1=1&nValor2=24436&nValor3=94042&param2=1&strTipM=TC&lResultado=9&strSim=simp|es,legislative,13/12/1994|Law passed||;30/06/2010|Last amended||,Energy;Residential and Commercial;Transportation,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Capacity building|Governance;Education, training and knowledge dissemination|Information",,Mitigation,,Law,,,Energy Demand;Transportation,Costa Rica,
2013.0,7th National Energy Plan 2015-2030,"The 7th National Energy Plan 2015-2030, published by Costa Rica's Ministry of Environment and Energy, aims to reach the objective of ""energy sustainability with low emission levels"" and supports the continuation of renewable energy development, energy efficiency and low-carbon emission transport. Energy currently constitutes 80% of Costa Rica's GHG emissions.<br />
It complements the National Development Plan 2015 -2018, which also calls for enhancing the use of renewable sources and improving efficiency in the use of energy, especially in the public sector (sectoral objectives 2 and 3).<br />
The Plan defines energy efficiency and distributed electricity generation as priorities for action and calls for the renovation of the vehicle fleet to include low carbon technologies, the promotion of sustainable public transport and the mainstreaming of clean fuels, in particular biofuels. Altogether, the Plan is organized along seven axes - four in the electricity production sector and three in the transport sector:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Improving energy efficiency</li><br />
<li>Optimal distributed electricity generation</li><br />
<li>Sustainability of the electricity grid</li><br />
<li>Sustainable electricity generation development</li><br />
<li>More environmentally friendly vehicle fleet</li><br />
<li>Sustainable public transport</li><br />
<li>Cleaner fuels</li><br />
</ul><br />
For each strategical axis, the Plan defines a set of concrete objectives (institutional and administrative reforms, new efficiency standards and certification, tariff adjustments, creation of funds, etc.), with varying deadlines for short/medium/long term.<br />
Concrete objectives include:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Expand renewable energy projects to reach 731.9 MW by 2018, additional 470 MW over 2019-2023, and additional 910 MW over 2024-2030 (subject to revision)</li><br />
<li>Expand the transmission lines by additional 313.5 km by 2018</li><br />
<li>Expand the distribution grid by additional 1921 km by 2018</li><br />
<li>By 2030, all houses not connected to the grid should have individual photovoltaic systems</li><br />

Directive 2004/101/EC reinforces the link between the EU's emission allowance trading scheme and the Kyoto Protocol by making the latter's 'project-based' mechanisms (Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism) compatible with the scheme. From 2005, all installations in the energy sector, iron and steel production and processing, the mineral industry, and the wood pulp, paper and board industry, and emitting the specific GHG associated with that activity, must possess a permit issued by the appropriate authorities. Each Member State must draw up a national plan indicating the allowances it intends to allocate for the relevant period and how it proposes to allocate them to each installation.

2002.0,Law no. 2015-992 on Energy Transition for Green Growth (Energy Transition Law),"The framework Energy Transition Law and its related action plans are designed to give France the means to diversify its energy mix and enhance its actions contributing to tackling climate change. It covers a large scope of economic activities and brings in binding energy targets for transport, housing sector and renewable energy. In its 215 articles, the law sets the following ambitious national targets:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>cut GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 and by 75% by 2050;</li><li>cut the national energy usage by at least 50% by 2050;</li><li>reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production by 30% compared to 2012;</li><li>cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and reduce France's reliance on nuclear power from the current 75% to 50% by 2030;</li><li>bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix by 2030.</li></ul><div><br>&nbsp;The law also increases the carbon tax on fossil fuel more than four times, from the 2015 rate of 14.5 euros to 56 euros per ton in 2020, and 100 euros in 2030, pending on ratification in the annual budget.<br>&nbsp;Renewable energy production is supported through simplified administrative procedures for onshore wind farms (art 143) and general permitting process for renewables (art 145). In addition, powers have been given to municipalities to develop district heating and cooling systems (art 194).<br>&nbsp;The adoption of the law is expected to create more than 75,000 new jobs in the housing sector through retro-fitting the ageing housing stock (which currently consumes about 50% of France's energy).<br>&nbsp;The law sets minimum energy consumption requirements for public buildings and, where possible, requires them to be energy positive. Minimum energy requirements applicable to social housing are extended from collective dwellings to individual housing (art 13). Energy upgrades or integration of renewable energy sources can also be mandated through local plans (art 8-I). Government support for energy upgrades is maintained (art 14-II and art 22) and the installation of smart meters is mandated by law (conditions apply - art 27) Administrative procedure for energy upgrades of communal parts of buildings is simplified, by recognizing simple majority voting among tenants (art 14-I). Similarly, procedures for building certification are simplified by allowing for certification at delivery of the new built (art 15). Individual billing for heating and electricity consumption are required in all buildings fitted with a collective heating and/or hot water system (art 26).<br><br>&nbsp;The law also contains a package of measures to tackle air pollution through a clean transport programme, which incentivises citizens to buy low-emission vehicles by installing approximately 7 million charging stations and dedicated parking places. The law also requires the State to prioritise electric and low-carbon vehicles in procurement (at least 50% of new procurement). Taxi and rental companies will also have to reach a minimum of 10% of low-carbon vehicles in their vehicle park. A subsidy for replacing old diesel vehicles by new ones is also provided, with a dedicated capped budget. In addition, metropolitan areas are allowed to reduce traffic speed on all or part of the city routes (art 47) and introduce temporary traffic bans against polluting vehicles across the city (art 49). Additional measures include: price reductions for access to public transport in case of traffic ban for certain type of vehicles (art 48); penalties for removing particulate filters (art 58); and optimal urban planning of the transport system contributing to reduction of air pollutants (art 66).<br><br>&nbsp;The law sets a requirement for investors to declare the environmental impact of their investment portfolios, including specific reference to impact on climate change. Article 173 imposes listed companies to disclose financial risks related to the effects of climate change and measures adopted by the company to reduce them; banks and credit providers shall disclose the risks evidenced by the stress-tests that are regularly implemented in their mandatory risk reports; and institutional investors must disclose information to beneficiaries on how their investment decision-making process takes social, environmental and governance criteria into consideration (including climate risk), and the means implemented to contribute to the financing of the ecological and energy transition.

1360.0,Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan,"The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) and its accompanying Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) established a framework for the sustainable development of Ireland's offshore renewable energy resource.<br />
The OREDP sets out the broader context for the development of Ireland's offshore wind and ocean renewable energy sectors, and the current state of play with regard to the range of policy areas that must be coordinated in order to create the conditions necessary to support the development of these sectors. A key output from the OREDP is the identification of ways to ensure the optimal coordination of a wide range of government departments, agencies and state bodies that are critical enablers for offshore wind and ocean energy development. The Plan identifies the next steps that must be taken to support the sustainable realisation of the economic potential of offshore renewable energy resources.<br />
Taking into account a number of energy, economic development and environmental issues, the Plan identifies ten policy and enabling actions, along with responsible bodies and completion timeframes, which are key to the development of the offshore renewable energy sector: (i) put in place a robust governance structure; (ii) increase exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration; (iii) introduce initial market support tariff for ocean energy; (iv) develop renewable electricity export markets; (v) develop the supply chain for the offshore renewable energy industry; (vi) communicate that Ireland is open for business; (vii) explore potential for international collaboration; (viii) introduce a new planning and consent architecture for development in the marine area; (ix) put in place a number of mitigation measures to protect the environment; and (x) ensure appropriate infrastructure development.",IRL,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaThJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a2d91dd8d79341714af4c3016aac4fb9bd6486ce/f|,executive,01/02/2014|Law passed,Energy;Industry;Transportation,"Zoning & Spatial Planning|Regulation;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",,Mitigation,,Plan,,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply,Ireland,

The Fund aims to support and improve energy efficiency improvement programmes, promote the development of a market for energy efficiency improvement measures, energy audits and other financial instruments for energy savings. It may also help alleviate energy poverty. The Fund may issue grants, loans and other financial guarantees or supports.<br />
The chapter also establishes Energy Efficiency Notices which the Minister may use to create binding obligations on energy providers to ensure their pricing is competitive, they promote energy efficiency improvement measures and contribute to the Fund. Where conditions in a Notice are not met, the Minister may order remedial action on the part of the supplier. In the case of persistent neglect of a Notice's orders, the Minister may appeal to the High Court for an order directing the energy supplier to comply.<br />
Energy suppliers may circumvent receiving a Notice order by establishing Voluntary Agreements, which detail how the energy supplier will meet the requirements that may be ordered in a Notice, for example, outlining energy saving objectives, energy efficiency improvement measures, monitoring, measuring and reporting procedures and so on. These Agreements are then to be submitted to the Minister for approval.

It also names institutions that shall pursue the analytical and managerial tasks needed to finance the transition, amend laws and take other measures to reach the overall emissions and efficiency targets.<br>&nbsp;<br> The Plan gives directions to reducing electricity consumption via setting up an advisory team to the Finance Minister and the Accountant General to consult on the objective of granting NIS 500 million over ten years for investment loans in energy efficiency and greenhouse gases emissions reductions. The grants program in energy efficiency will be operated by the Investment Centre and the National Authority for Technology and Innovation. The decision stipulates that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis over the economic performance of emissions reduction per unit of electricity saved. The Ministry of Finance alone shall allocate a budget of NIS 300 million.<br>&nbsp;<br> The decision tasks the Ministry of Energy to: 1) provide a multi-year plan for energy efficiency for 2030, 2) evaluate how to reduce electricity consumption, 3) amend the law accordingly to institute a mechanism for generating units of energy saved (Negawatts) in energy supply and demand, and to use electricity bills as a clearinghouse for repayment of loans, taking into consideration financial exposure of electricity providers. The decision also charges the Finance Minister in concentration with the Energy Minister to consider an update in tax policy regarding the deprecation for energy-saving products. Photovoltaic commercial facilities in particular will be granted a tax benefit in form of an accelerated depreciation at a 20 % rate over a three-year period.<br>&nbsp;<br> In terms of energy efficiency in buildings, the Plan urges the Energy Minister, the Environmental Protection Minister, the Construction and Housing Minister, and the Finance Minister to evaluate how to update the Energy Sources Law of 1989 to establish energy ratings for new residential buildings and offices based on Israeli Standard 5282. The Housing and Energy Ministers must explain how to achieve the emissions reduction target of of 5.9 M tCO2e by 2030 in the building sector, notably by 1) increase the number of new buildings built under the country's principal green building standard, SI 5281, and 2) assess technical means.<br>&nbsp;<br> Other measures in the Plan include a confirmation of the governmental efforts to achieve a 10 % target for electricity generation from renewables by 2020, in accordance with Government Decision 4450 of January 2009.",ISR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcklIIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e26f02a57d3db0f77ebb6e27bafdcad00a674291/f|,executive,10/04/2016|Law passed||,Energy;Residential and Commercial,"Subsidies|Economic;Tax incentives|Economic;Provision of climate funds|Direct Investment;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",Mitigation,Mitigation,,Plan,,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Carbon Pricing;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Transportation,Israel,

The white certificates represent marketable documents issued by the Energy Market Administrator testifying the energy saved by the energy distribution companies - as well as by their controlled partnerships - and by the Energy Service Companies (ESCO). The white certificates can be exchanged by means of bilateral contracts, or in the frame of a specific market ruled by GME.<br />
<br />
Energy service providers, subsidiaries of electricity and gas distributors and distributors themselves will all sell energy efficiency certificates (white certificates) each representing primary energy savings of one tonne of oil equivalent (toe).<br />
<br />
Distribution companies must meet specified energy savings targets, either by implementing energy conservation projects that benefit their customers, which will earn them white certificates, or through the purchase of white certificates produced by energy conservation projects undertaken by others.",ITA,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbzBKIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--9f58592cf55b26d7bbffe66bea974235e8a012ed/f|,executive,25/12/2005|Law passed,Energy,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Policy,,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Carbon Pricing;Energy Supply;Energy Demand,Italy,
1398.0,Introduction of the Green Certificates System,"This legislation completes the introduction of a cap-and-trade mechanism to promote renewable energy sources. It introduces the green certificates that producers and importers can buy.<br />
<br />
Energy - demand-side policies: the 1999 Electricity Liberalisation Act and Decrees from the Ministries of Trade and Industry and of Environment (Legislative decree 79/99 of 16 March 1999 entitled; Ministry of Productive Activities decree 18.03.02; Followed by Ministry of Productive Activities decree 14.03.04, implementing the rules for the green certificates) introduced a cap-and-trade mechanism to promote renewable energy sources. It required Italian energy producers and importers (producing or importing more than 100 GWh/year from conventional sources) to ensure that a certain quota of electricity fed into the grid comes from renewable energy sources, aiming at a general reduction of CO2 emissions of about 4Mt - 6Mt by 2006.<br />
<br />
A 2% quota obligation was set, strengthened in 2003 and again in 2008. Producers and importers can comply with the obligation by means of green certificates. They can buy those certificates through bilateral contracts or by participating in the green certificates platform (managed by GME, the energy markets operator).<br />
<br />
Suppliers can fulfil the obligation by buying green certificates from eligible new renewable energy plants, by building new renewable energy plants or by importing electricity from new renewable energy plants from countries with similar instruments on the basis of reciprocity. Renewable energy producers in operation before 31 December 2007 can obtain green certificates for 12 years. Subsequent regulatory interventions have increased the incentive period to 15 years.",ITA,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBb29KIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--aa2cded6a7ffa9071adb6f33e98a0e886e04ab66/f|,executive,25/12/2002|Law passed,Energy;Residential and Commercial,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Policy,,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Carbon Pricing;Energy Supply,Italy,

1416.0,Law Concerning the Rational Use of Energy (Energy Conservation Act) (Law No.49 of 1979),"The Law is the pillar of Japanese energy conservation policy as well as one of the two key climate law. It was enacted in 1979 in the light of the oil shock with a purpose of promoting effective and rational use of energy. It covers the following sectors: energy management in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors; energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances. The subjects of the Law are factories and workplaces that consume more than 1,500kL of oil equivalent energy annually. Among factories, there are two categories: Factory I that uses more than 3,000kL equivalent; and Factory II that uses between 1,500-3,000kL equivalent. Currently, it covers approximately 90% of the operators in the industrial sector.<br />
<br />
Energy defined under this Law covers energies derived from oil, natural gas, coals, heat (fossil-derived) and other sources of energy derived from the above. Electricity derived from renewable sources such as solar PV, wind and biomass are not subject for this Law. Designated businesses are required to produce reports (regular reporting for Factory II, both regular and mid-term reporting for Factory I) to the Energy Agency of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The purpose of this is to report amount of fuel, heat and electricity used in the subject period. Reduction target of 1% on average is set out under the law, with a fine up to JPY1m (USD8,495) according to the violation.<br />
<br />
This Law also mandates an appointment of licensed energy managers for the designated businesses. Other measures include energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances, energy conservation labelling, energy regulation for housing and building and Positive Evaluation of Action to Reduce Peak Demand Electricity.<br />

2058.0,Fundamental Law on Energy Policy (Basic Act on Energy Policy) and its Strategic Plans (Law No. 71 of 2002),"A lawmaker-initiated legislation, this Law sought to set out the country's fundamental and overall energy policy direction after the approval of the Diet. It sets the principles on the use of market mechanisms to encourage a secure and more environmentally friendly supply of energy. It provides that the State has a responsibility to create overarching energy plans ('Strategic Energy Plan', or 'Basic Energy Plan') and commit to reducing environmental impacts. The role of subnational governments is to implement the national measures in own jurisdiction.<br />
A Strategic Energy Plan sets out basic energy measures, long-term and comprehensive measures and research and development needed to achieve the above. The Plan is sent to discussion and adoption by the Diet, and to date four plans have been adopted (October 2003, March 2007, June 2010, April 2014).<br />
The Fourth Strategic Energy Plan (April 2014) added safety into the basic policy perspective, on top of the 3 elements ('the 3Es') mentioned in the previous plans: energy security, economic efficiency and environment (collectively known as '3E+S'). Diversification of energy sources and flexible and efficient energy demand structure are the two basic pillars of energy policy, reflecting the learning from the 2011 energy crisis. Promotion of resilient energy supply structure and improvement of self-sufficiency of energy supply are emphasised as national interest for energy policy.<br />
In particular, the Fourth Strategic Energy Plan sets the following targets:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Efficient lighting equipment (e.g. LED lighting and organic EL lighting): target ""penetration rate of 100% on a flow basis by 2020 and on a stock basis by 2030"" (page 39)</li><br />
<li>Low-emission vehicles: target increase in the ""ratio of next-generation vehicles to all new vehicles to 50%-70% by 2030 while promoting comprehensive measures, including steps to improve traffic flow such as the development of loop routes and other trunk road networks and introduction of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which will contribute to energy efficiency' (page 40)</li><br />

1421.0,Law about Support of Use of Renewable Sources of Energy No. 165-4,"This piece of legislation aims to eliminate previous legal and financial barriers to the development of renewable energy projects, thus facilitating new projects and access to regional energy grids, as well as regulating energy pricing to ensure that energy from renewable sources is cost-comparable to fossil fuels.<br />
<br />
The law was a necessary step in order to realise the reduction in GHG emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy (defined as solar, wind hydropower, biomass, and geothermal energy) consumed relative to fossil fuels. The law does not, however, specify a percentage share of renewable energy.<br />
<br />
The text lays the legal framework to develop national and regional programmes to exploit renewable energy, establish norms associated with renewable energy production, and issue permits for new projects and plants. This regulatory authority will rest in a government-authorised body (of the executive branch) in charge of all renewable energy programmes.<br />
<br />
At the regional and local levels, the Authority both authorises local executive authorities to participate in the planning and approval of local and regional projects to develop renewable energy up to 25MW and obliges them to reserve and allocate local lands to said projects, within the framework of the law.<br />
<br />
Renewable energy prices are set by the provider but must not exceed the estimated price stated in the feasibility study submitted to and approved by the appropriate governing body. Those companies operating regional power grids are legally obliged to buy all renewable energy produced by plants connected to the grid up to 50% of their total energy purchases. Should renewable energy exceed 50% of energy purchased by companies operating regional energy grids, the national grid shall purchase the surplus in its entirety. Additional incentives to develop renewable energy projects include prioritising the connection of renewable energy plants to energy grids and the use of renewable energy once those plants have access to the grids, and the exclusion of 'service payments' associated with the sale and purchase of traditionally produced energy.<br />
<br />
This law codifies the requirement that by 2024 5% of Kazakhstan's total energy consumption must come from renewable sources.",KAZ,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBblFKIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--0b4234dc109110f3819121d4224c517289f2e839/f|,legislative,05/07/2009|Law passed,Energy,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Subnational and citizen participation|Governance",,Mitigation,,Law,,,Research And Development;Energy Supply,Kazakhstan,

<br />
It states that the state shall prioritise prevention and mitigation of climate change and regulate according to principles that limit the amount of GHGs released into the atmosphere. The law authorises a governmental body to monitor climate change and ozone layer and further charges that body with using scientific information to develop measures at the national level specific to various economic sectors to reduce the discharge of GHGs into the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
The law also outlines the regulatory authority of the state of Kazakhstan to issue limits (quotas) on the emissions of GHGs and ozone-destroying gases.

2015.0,Energy Transition Law,"The Energy Transition Act's purpose is to promote sustainable and efficient use of energy, regulate the obligations of power companies related to the mandatory share of clean energies (including natural gas, and CCS with emissions not exceeding 100 kg/MWh), and push for the reduction of the polluting emissions of the electric power industry while ensuring competitiveness of the clean power sector within the new wholesale electricity market.<br />
According to the law, the Secretariat of Energy (SENER) should promote generation of clean power to reach the levels set forth in the Climate Change Act for the electric power industry, including: a minimum share of clean energies in power generation of 25 % by 2018, 30 % by 2021, 35 % by 2024.<br />
SENER is also responsible for establishing obligations for mandatory acquisition of clean energy certificates that the suppliers and qualified users participating in the wholesale power market and the holders of interconnection agreements must comply with on an annual basis. The issuance of clean energy certificates (CECs) is expected to begin from 2018 and will serve both as a green incentive and a regulatory mechanism to meet the country's clean energy goals. A transitory provision, valid for four years, allows companies to defer 50 % of their CEC acquisition obligation for two years under specific conditions.<br />
The law also establishes the National Commission for Efficient Use of Energy (CONUEE), tasked with promoting energy efficiency, providing scientific advice in matters of clean energy, and drafting the Energy Strategy that sets medium and long term goals (15 and 30 years horizon respectively) as well as the National Programme for Sustainable Use of Energy (PRONASE - Chapter V of the Energy Transition Act), the two main implementation tools of the law.<br />
The law further establishes a Smart Grid Programme to promote grid modernization to maintain a reliable and secure infrastructure to meet electricity demand in an economically efficient and sustainable manner.<br />
The Act also stipulates that costs previously externalised (including health and environmental impacts) are now to be included in evaluation of costs associated with operation and expansion of the Electricity Industry.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Act abrogates the Law for the Use of Renewable Energies and the Financing of the Energy Transition (LAERFTE 2008), the Law for the Sustainable Use of Energy (LASE 2008) and any related legal provisions opposing this new Act. The funds from the Energy Transition Fund established by LAERFTE are to be transferred to the Federal Budget and redirected as new funds for energy transition and sustainable energy use.<br />

There is an explicit acknowledgement of the risks posed to water, food and energy security posed by climate change; and the need to minimise the risks from the increased frequency and intensity of events like floods and droughts.&nbsp;<br><br>The policy seeks international finance to support the development required to meet these numerous challenges. However, in addition to directly seeking finance, the policy seeks to create economic incentives to encourage public and private sector investment in adaptation measures and the promotion of conservation of natural resources and long-term sustainability.

1530.0,National Forest Policy,"This policy (supported by caveats in the National Environment Policy) addresses the sustainable use of renewable natural resources. It acknowledges the multiple functions of Pakistan's forests, such as carbon storage for climate change mitigation. However, there is a particularly strong focus on forests' role in mountain areas where they provide protection from soil erosion and reduction of downstream siltation; and crucially, watershed protec-tion. It also notes the potential of forests to support local livelihoods in terms of provision of non-timber forest products (mushrooms, medicinal plants etc.).

Much of Pakistan's forests have now been cleared, increasing the importance of managing what remains under a framework of sustainable use. In particular the sustainable use should benefit marginalised groups such as women and children. Use of existing resources should be complemented with forest restoration activities to attempt to regenerate forests in order to safeguard economic growth.

Approaches to achieve the desired sustainable use of forests include the substitution of firewood and timber (specifically discouraging the use of rare species in government buildings); and the prevention of encroachment on remaining forest lands through regulation of grazing.

In order to finance the protection of watersheds and safeguard Pakistan's water supply, the forest policy stipulates the creation of a forest fund. The fund may also be used to finance the promotion of forestry research and education in Pakistan.

1533.0,National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS): Pakistan's pathway to a sustainable and resilient future,"The goal of the NSDS is 'vibrant and equitable economic growth' that delivers benefits to all, particularly the poor and the vulnerable, in a way which does not lead to undue exploitation or degradation of natural resources.<br />
<br />
The need for the NSDS is stark since the country faces a series of significant challenges: Growth rates are currently largely coupled to resource and natural material use, leading to continued environmental degradation. This has contributed to increasing water scarcity, a significant problem given that storage capacity and water efficiency delivery is low. In the energy sector, thermal efficiency is low, distribution losses are high, and power cuts are reported to be a common frustration for domestic and business users. In addition, strategic energy reserves are low. These problems are set against a backdrop of high poverty and illiteracy rates in addition to increased impacts of natural hazards, notably the impact of disastrous flooding.<br />
The three core programme areas addressed are:<br />
? Economic: Sustainable trade, Cleaner Production, and Sustainable Consumption<br />
? Environment: Natural capital and Biodiversity<br />
? Social: Social protection, poverty alleviation and equal opportunity/human development.<br />
<br />
The strategic goals of the programme are to:<br />
- Promote green investment and green jobs<br />
- Improve eco-efficiency by changing production and consumption systems<br />
- Internalisation of environmental costs into pricing<br />
- Develop sustainable infrastructure focusing on transportation and communication<br />
- Develop demand for sustainable consumption among consumers through awareness raising<br />
- Account for depletion of natural resources in national accounts<br />
- Promote efficient use of energy and water, including through improved watershed management and reforestation<br />
- Improve biodiversity management and increase forest cover; prepare lists of endangered species<br />
- Deliver basic services of acceptably high quality to all citizens. These would cover 10 years of schooling, healthcare, food, water, shelter and energy<br />

<div class=""section"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">

This Act requires electric service providers to make a net metering program available to customers by which customers may establish a renewable energy-powered customer generation system to produce electricity for their own use and to supply excess electricity to the electric service provider. The Act requires the electric service provider to offset charges for electricity by the amount of electricity supplied by the customer from the customer generation system and requires the electric service provider to give the customer credit for electricity generated by the customer that exceeds the amount supplied by the electric service provider. It requires the customer to meet certain safety requirements with respect to the customer generating system. It prohibits the electric service provider from imposing additional charges or fees to customers participating in a net metering program.

Through net metering, Palau hopes to 1) encourage investment in renewable energy resources, 2) stimulate economic growth, 3) reduce demand for electricity when alternative energy is available, 4) enhance the continued diversification of the energy resources used in Palau, 5) reduce fossil fuel imports for electricity generation and increase energy independence, and 6) reduce carbon emissions.

1548.0,Framework Strategy on Climate Change,"The National Framework Strategy sketches a clean development path, and serves as a roadmap for national and sub-national development and investment programmes, physical and land use programmes. Acknowledging the Philippines' vulnerability to climate change, the Framework's vision is 'to build the adaptive capacity of communities and increase resilience of natural eco-systems to climate change, and optimise mitigation opportunities towards sustainable development'.<br />
<br />
On renewable energy, it states a target of doubling renewable energy capacity from 4,500 MW to 9,000 MW in the next 20 years<br />
<br />
The mitigation pillar leans on managing energy demand, via energy efficiency and conservation programmes, and on energy supply, via use of low-carbon and renewable energy resources, targeting a doubling of renewable energy capacity by 2030. It encourages low-carbon transportation modes (LPG, bio-fuels) and sustainable, energy-conserving infrastructure building. The infrastructure emphasises the importance of REDD+ policies as a measure to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Waste management and methane collection are also included in mitigation priorities.<br />
<br />
The Adaptation pillar includes enhanced vulnerability and adaptation assessments, eco-system management (river basin management, coastal and marine systems, biodiversity); water management; climate-responsive agriculture; climate-responsive health sector; climate-proofing infrastructure; and disaster risk reduction.<br />
<br />
The synergy between mitigation and adaptation is emphasised, and cross-cutting strategies are portrayed, among others capacity building in all level of governance, knowledge management and education; research and development and technology transfer.

1561.0,Energy Efficiency Law,"This Act transposes Directive 2006/32/EC into Polish law, establishing the legal framework for stimulating investment in energy efficiency in Poland. The system is based on the obligation of the specified entities to obtain and present for cancellation to the President of the Energy Regulatory Authority specified number of certificates of energy efficiency (the so called white certificates) or the payment of a replacement fee. This obligation has been imposed on energy companies selling electricity, heat and natural gas to end-users connected to the Polish network, as well as end-users of energy and brokerage houses and commodity brokerage houses, conducting transactions on a commodity exchange market.<br />

Following the issuance of the EEL, the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued secondary legislation to enable the EEL to enter into force: Decree of 10 August 2012 that detailed the procedure of energy efficiency audit and describes the methods of computing energy savings; Decree of 4 September 2012 on computing primary energy savings for the purpose of the White Certificate System (WCS) and the compensation fee in the system; Decree of 23 October 2012 on the procedures of the bid for the White Certificates and listed the eligible energy efficiency means eligible in the WCS.<br />
<br />
The original EEL was amended on 10 October 2012, dropping the articles that defined specific requirements of the energy efficiency auditors. This move was mainly induced by the government's policy to open different occupations to make the market of services they provide more competitive and flexible.<br />

The Law calls for a number of follow-up implementing by-laws. Various sub-laws to the 2009 Energy Efficiency legislation further define the tasks and responsibilities. Under the Law, all energy resources produced, transmitted, and consumed are subject to compulsory accounting by virtue of the respective meters.

The Law contains energy efficiency rules for circulation of goods (energy efficiency classification of goods, labelling, prohibition of non-efficient incandescent bulbs etc.). It establishes a general rule that buildings and other structures should meet applicable energy efficiency requirements both when being commissioned and during their subsequent operation. State construction supervisory authorities shall assign energy efficiency classes to apartment buildings.

The Law sets the conditions for voluntary or mandatory energy audits and encourages energy-saving technologies including, but not limited to, the use of secondary energy resources and renewable energy sources.

State programmes aimed at energy savings and energy efficiency increases are expected to set such targets as the number of facilities relying on secondary energy resources or renewable energy sources for their energy supplies.

Instruments: Tax incentives include investment tax credits of up to 30% for companies investing in energy efficiency technologies, accelerated depreciation of high energy efficiency assets or sites and partial compensation of interest on loans granted by Russian banks for the purpose of investing in energy saving and increased energy efficiency technologies.

Its main targets relate to: strategic infrastructure investment for exports; more private sector financing to increase exports; urbanisation; and a green economy approach to sustainability. Five priority areas will spearhead this thematic strategy.<br />
<br />
Priority 1 is to increase the domestic interconnectivity of the economy by investing in infrastructure to meet private sector energy demand; increasing access to public goods and resources in priority sectors; and deepening the integration of key value chains.<br />
<br />
Priority 5 is the pursuit of a ‘green economy' approach to economic transformation, favouring the development of sustainable cities and villages. Key innovations include: piloting a green city; piloting a model mine; and attracting investors in green construction. There will be a focus on green urbanisation and promoting green innovation in industry and the private sector. A Green Urbanisation Centre of Excellence and an Environment and Climate Change Innovation Centre will be created. The Environment and Climate Change Centre will promote transformational green innovation in the industrial and private sectors through (i) support to research and development through links to industry and academia in Rwanda and internationally; (ii) promoting technology transfer in priority sectors through business advice and training; (iii) linking innovation with finance through identifying international funding sources (e.g. FONERWA); (iv) providing analyses and information on market and sector trends.<br />
<br />
Environment and climate change are considered ‘cross cutting issues'. They involve (i) mainstreaming environmental sustainability into productive and social sectors; (ii) reducing vulnerability to climate change and (iii) preventing and controlling pollution. Key sectors include agriculture, energy, environment and natural resources, infrastructure, health, private sector and financial sector.<br />

Energy efficiency and conservation are also promoted to minimise energy intensity. Public-private partnerships, transparent, inclusive and informed policy making in an adequately framed energy sector are key elements highlighted by the policy to achieve the country's sustainable energy targets. Such an institutional framework encompasses the collection, monitoring and reporting of carbon emissions stemming from the electricity sector. New building codes and mandatory installation of solar thermal collectors for major water users shall also be implemented.<br />

This Plan determines how Samoa plan to meet their SDG targets regarding the natural environment and its links to human activities, which include agriculture, water and sanitation, infrastructure, energy and tourism. It distinguishes between eight types of environments, such as upland, lowland, coastal and protected habitats.

One key objective of the plan is to implement ecosystem-based strategies to support climate change mitigation and adaptation. It also identifies the following ways to adapt to climate change impacts: 1) implement sustainable plans for improving the protection of critical catchment areas, 2) assign priority to securing the full protection of the entire Apia, Vaisigano and Tafitoala catchment areas, 3) promote and support the replanting of catchment and erosion prone areas, 4) promote and support the replanting of mangrove forests and exposed coastal areas, 5) encourage and facilitate the relocation of households away from high risk flood-prone areas, 6) promote the growing of food crops that are not vulnerable to wind damage, 7) support the full implementation of Samoa's NAPA, 8) encourage the implementation of natural solutions to enhance coastal resilience to climate change, 9) promote efforts to rehabilitate all degraded land areas through the replanting of appropriate tree species and the use of sustainable soil management techniques, and 10) develop and promote sustainable models of future climate for project sites based on a range of climate change scenarios.

1619.0,National Climate Change Strategy,"The National Climate Change Strategy 2012 (replacing a previous version published in 2008), produced by the National Climate Change Secretariat, provides a comprehensive overview of Singapore's response to climate change. It reiterates the country's pledge, first made in 2009, to reduce emissions by 16% below 2020 business-as-usual levels if there is a legally-binding global agreement in which all countries implement their commitments in good faith. Ahead of this, Singapore has embarked on policies and measures that will reduce its emissions by 7% to 11% below 2020 BAU levels.<br />
<br />
The strategy identifies accelerated coastal erosion, higher incidences of intense rain or prolonged drought, biodiversity impacts, and disruption to food and other supplies as potential climate change impacts facing Singapore. It reiterates the country's commitment to a multilateral approach to dealing with climate change, and argues that a global approach will be more conducive towards Singapore's long-term growth and development. It highlights Singapore's position on a global climate agreement as one that supports the UN model of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.<br />
<br />
The strategy outlines three key principles that guide Singapore's response to climate change:<br />
- Long-term and integrated planning;<br />
- Pragmatically and economically sound measures; and<br />
- Developing innovative solutions for Singapore and global markets.<br />
<br />
It also identifies four main approaches that Singapore will follow in addressing climate change:<br />
- Reducing carbon emissions in all sectors;<br />
- Being ready to adapt to the effects of climate change;<br />
- Harnessing green growth opportunities; and<br />
- Forging partnerships (e.g. with international and regional bodies).<br />
<br />
The document contains chapters on the importance of climate change and Singapore's national circumstances and constraints, as well as detailed chapters on both mitigation and adaptation plans and policies.In terms of mitigation, energy efficiency is the country's core strategy (given the country's limited access to renewable energy opportunities). Specific identified strategies to reduce emissions across different sectors include:<br />
- Power generation: switching fuel mix away from fuel oil to natural gas;<br />
- Water: incinerate sludge rather than dispose in landfills;<br />
- Households: extend minimum energy performance standards to lighting and other appliances;<br />
- Buildings: require Green Mark certification for all new buildings;<br />
- Transport: implement carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme to encourage purchase of low carbon emission cars; and<br />
- Industry: develop and support energy efficiency financing pilot schemes.<br />
<br />
The strategy identifies coastline protection, addressing flood risks, and managing water resources as the three key adaptation priorities of Singapore, and also focuses heavily on green growth as a development model. Finally, it outlines the various local and international partnerships (e.g. with other countries/cities) that Singapore is engaged in.",SGP,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbWNHIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--2d3d2365fc1935a7a079a455d6e89fd703908c8d/f|,executive,14/06/2012|Law passed,Coastal zones;Energy;Environment;Residential and Commercial;Transportation;Waste;Water,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Zoning & Spatial Planning|Regulation;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",Adaptation;Mitigation,Adaptation;Mitigation,"Flooding;Droughts;Storms, Hurricanes, Tsunamis, Cyclones;Sea Level Rise;Changes In Average Precipitation",Strategy,,,Adaptation;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Transportation,Singapore,

It defines specific options for support for renewable electricity, including the timeframe of guaranteed price of purchase. It also originally mandated electricity producers with capacity of 50MW to produce electricity with minimum of 20% share of renewable resources. Hydrogen is recognised as a renewable energy source alongside wind, solar, biofuels and biomass.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Due to its generous feed-in tariffs for solar energy, Slovakia witnessed an unanticipated 'solar boom' in early 2011. As a result, in February 2011, the size of the solar installations eligible for these subsidies was scaled back to 100kW, and feed-in tariffs were nearly halved compared to 2009.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In August 2012, another amendment changed the conditions for producers of electricity from small solar rooftop installations with installed capacities of up to 10 kW. Operators of these installations may now generate electricity for their own use without having to register as an entrepreneur.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;According to a 2013 amendment, the feed-in tariff will apply only to rooftop photovoltaic installations on with a maximum capacity of 30kW. All larger installations are no longer be covered by the support mechanism. The initial version of the amendment also envisaged promoting high efficiency cogeneration up to an installed capacity of 300MW, but it was eventually revoked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Feed-in tariffs are limited to installations producing electricity from renewable energy sources or CHP with installed power up to 5MW (15MW in the case of wind power). The feed-in tariff and other support are provided to electricity producers during 15 years since the commissioning of the installation or its renovation (conditions apply).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Act also specifies the quotas for increase in share of biofuels in the transport fuels for individual years between 2011 and 2020. The share of biofuels should reach 8.5% by the end of 2020.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Law mandates the Ministry of Economy to set the national target for share of energy from renewable sources in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan.

1643.0,National Climate Change Response Policy White Paper (NCCRP),"The National Climate Change Response Policy is a comprehensive plan to address both mitigation and adaptation in the short, medium and long term (up to 2050). GHG emissions are set to stop increasing at the latest by 2020-2025, to stabilise for up to 10 years and then to decline in absolute terms.<br />
<br />
Strategies are specified for the following areas:<br />
- Carbon Pricing<br />
- Water<br />
- Agriculture and commercial forestry<br />
- Health<br />
- Biodiversity and ecosystems<br />
- Human settlements<br />
- Disaster risk reduction and management<br />
<br />
The policy has two main objectives: first, to manage inevitable climate change impacts through interventions that build and sustain social, economic and environmental resilience and emergency response capacity. Secondly, to make a fair contribution to the global effort to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
The Policy specifies strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation, making use of the short-, medium- and long-term planning horizons (up to five years from publication of policy, up to 20 years, up to 2050, respectively). The White Paper outlines a risk-based process to identify and prioritise adaptation strategies and interventions that have to be taken in the short and medium term, while reviewed every five years.<br />
<br />
Concerning mitigation, it includes proposals to set emission reduction outcomes for each significant sector and sub-sector of the economy based on an in-depth assessment of the mitigation potential, best available mitigation options and a full assessment of the costs and benefits using a 'carbon budgets' approach. It also proposed the deployment of a range of economic instruments, including the appropriate pricing of carbon and economic incentives, as well as the possible use of emissions offset or emission reduction trading mechanisms for those relevant sectors, sub-sectors, companies or entities where a carbon budget approach has been selected.<br />
<br />
Energy Efficiency and Energy and Demand Management flagship programmes cover development and facilitation of an aggressive energy efficiency programme in industry, building on previous Demand Side Management programmes, and covering non-electricity energy efficiency as well. A structured programme will be established with appropriate initiatives, incentives and regulation, along with a well-resourced information collection and dissemination process. Local governments are encouraged to take an active part in demand-side management.<br />
<br />
There is a short-term transportation flagship programme, which aims to facilitate the development of an enhanced public transportation programme to promote lower-carbon mobility in five metros and in ten smaller cities and create an Efficient Vehicles Programme with interventions that result in measurable improvements in the average efficiency of the vehicle fleet by 2020. The planned rail recapitalisation programme is considered an important component of this Flagship Programme due to its projected contribution to modal shifts of passengers and freight. The programme further introduces a Government Vehicle Efficiency Programme that will measurably improve the efficiency of the government vehicle fleet by 2020, by setting procurement objectives for efficient technology vehicles such as electric vehicles.<br />
<br />
In the medium term, the plan calls for significant up-scaling of energy efficiency applications in transportation; and for promoting transport-related interventions including transportation modal shifts (road to rail, private to public transport) and switches to alternative vehicles (e.g. electric and hybrid vehicles) and lower-carbon fuels.<br />
<br />
The principles of the White Paper include prioritising co-operation and the promotion of research, investment in and/or acquisition of adaptation, lower-carbon and energy-efficient technologies, practices and processes for employment by existing or new sectors or sub-sectors. All fields and flagship programmes include a key element of research and development, data collection and analysis tools in their respective areas.<br />
<br />
Adaptation efforts are prioritised, acknowledging the vulnerability of the country. Adaptation efforts will require: early warning and forecasting for disaster risk reduction; medium-term (decade-scale) climate forecasting to identify potential resource challenges well in advance; and long-term climate projections that define the range of future climate conditions. Adaptation strategies are to be integrated into sectoral plans, including: The National Water Resource Strategy, as well as reconciliation strategies for particular catchments and water supply systems; The Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture; The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, as well as provincial biodiversity sector plans and local bioregional plans; The Department of Health Strategic Plan; The Comprehensive Plan for the Development of Sustainable Human Settlements; and the National Framework for Disaster Risk Management.<br />
<br />
In order to monitor success of measures, South Africa will, within two years of the publication of the policy, design and publish a draft Climate Change Response Measurement and Evaluation System.",ZAF,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdm9GIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--33a82f3d058b15e32775b533f7d86e88e44336aa/f|,executive,18/10/2011|Approved by cabinet,Economy-wide;Energy;Environment;Industry;LULUCF;Residential and Commercial;Transportation;Water,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;MRV|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",Adaptation;Mitigation;Drm/Drr,Adaptation;Disaster Risk Management;Mitigation,"Floods;Droughts;Storms, Hurricanes, Tsunamis, Cyclones;Wildfires;Heat Waves And Heat Stress;Soil Erosion;Sea Level Rise",Policy,,,Adaptation;Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Carbon Pricing;Energy Supply;Transportation,South Africa,

1668.0,Law 24/2013 on the Electric sector,"This Law repealed Law 54/1997, which previously regulated the sector. The main driver for the law was to reduce the unsustainable tariff deficit of the electricity sector.

A new support scheme for renewable energy sources is planned, based on the direct participation of renewable energy sources in the market, forcing them to compete with traditional sources, although the scheme will allow renewable energies to recover costs that could not be recovered by selling energy on the market. The evaluation of such costs will be based on a theoretical renewable plant and on the average costs incurred by a well-managed company running said installation. Only administrative costs that are uniform at national level will be considered, so administrative costs at regional level are not considered in the framework of the law. The law allows for additional support schemes, but only if they are necessary to achieve European goals. With respect to grid access and grid use, renewables are granted priority connection and priority dispatch - provided that these do not constitute a danger to the grid itself.

Law 24/2013 regulates the economic framework for self-production-and consumption of electricity, a topic that had been in debate for months between different stakeholders. It states that entities that consume the energy they produce will have to make the same contribution to the financing of costs and services of the grid as consumers that take the electricity directly from the grid. This point had been at the centre of the debate and was strongly opposed by renewable energy associations, who thought it would create strong barriers to consumers installing their own renewable generating system. The fine for producers who access the self-consumption scheme incorrectly is set between EUR6m and EUR60m (USD7.53m-USD75.3m).

Order 360/2018 foresees an update, at least annual, of the remuneration related to production facilities from renewable sources, high efficiency cogeneration and waste. and

The Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), of the Secretariat of State for Energy of the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism is responsible for its follow-up.<br />
<br />
The Plan offers an additional analysis in relation to the PANER, including a detailed sectorial analysis covering a technological development outlook and costs forecast. Additionally, the Plan had to undergo a Strategic Environmental Assessment process to harmonise its environmental objectives with the planning process.<br />
<br />
During the preparation of this plan, the Parliamentary sub-committee in charge of outlining the Spanish energy strategy for the next 25 years, adjusted the national 2020 target for renewable energy to 20.8% of gross final energy consumption, in response to the effects of the current economic downturn.

New units are only permitted when they replace existing units (a maximum of 10), whereby the older reactor must be permanently disabled and the new reactor needs to be built on an existing nuclear facility instead of a new location.

The laws reverse the phase-out of nuclear power production, repealing the Nuclear Phase-Out Act and the ban on new nuclear power facilities.

The purpose of the law is to allow old nuclear reactors to be replaced with newer, safer models. It also reflects the recent shift towards new carbon technologies as opposed to a stronger expansion of renewable energies classified as counting towards climate mitigation. The Swedish parliament approved the act under the condition that no direct or indirect public funding may be available for the new nuclear power reactors.

Parliament also stipulated that operators of nuclear facilities and the owners of nuclear power reactors carry unlimited liability in the event of a nuclear accident.

1684.0,An Integrated Climate and Energy Policy,"Passed by the Riksdag in 2009, these laws originating in two government bills form the basis of Sweden's flagship climate policy, known as 'an Integrated Climate and Energy Policy.<br />
<br />
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).<br />
<br />
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.<br />
<br />
Targets outlined in this legislation include:<br />
- 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)<br />
- 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020<br />
- 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)<br />
- 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector<br />
- by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating<br />
- by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels<br />

Initially covering the whole of the above sectors, the tax was reformed after the launch of the EU carbon-trading scheme and was kept for industry and non-industry emitters outside of the EU ETS scheme.<br />
Initially set at a general level of USD120 per ton of CO2 (different rates for coal fuels, kerosene and engine oils on domestic flights, natural gas, and LPG) - the carbon tax was progressively raised in 2013 to USD349 per tonne of CO2 for coal fuels and up to USD418 per tonne of CO2 for natural gas used for non-travel purposes for the sectors still concerned by the tax. Both peat and biofuels are exempt from the tax, as well as fuels used for electricity production. Until 2015, minor tax relief was also granted for natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) used in cars, ships, and aircraft; however, from 2015 the same level of tax will apply to all fossil fuels.

The initial levy was set at CHF12 (USD12.5) per tonne of CO2, which equates to CHF0.03 USD.03)/litre of heating oil and CHF 0.025 (USD.026)/m3 of natural gas. As CO2 emission reductions were not on track to meet the commitments, the CO2 tax was increased to CHF36 (USD37.6) per tonne of CO2. The revenues of the first phase (2008-2010) were re-distributed to employers and to the population on a per-capita basis. Since 2010, one third of the revenues have been channelled to the building refurbishment programme (about CHF300m, USD313m).",CHE,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbzhJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--7b21eea9eb948c68e0227a80794d47f3b52eb320/f|,executive,01/01/2013|Law passed,Energy;Residential and Commercial,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation",,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Policy,,,Adaptation;Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Carbon Pricing;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Redd+ And Lulucf;Transportation,Switzerland,

1699.0,National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation,"The National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation was approved and adopted by the Governmental Decree No.259. The Action Plan identifies the major policy directions and priorities to reduce GHG emission and adapt to climate change under national policy. This policy functions as the basis for implementation by all levels of governments and sectors.<br />
<br />
The Action Plan starts with an analysis of trends and scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic GHG emissions. The gases subject to analysis are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. Impacts on water resources are regarded as the key concern in the face of climate change, due to glacier retreat, increase in evaporation and decrease in river flow due to temperature rise. Change in regional hydrological cycles is expected to have destructive impact on the scale and impact of natural disasters. Change in water quality is considered a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity and economy (e.g. irrigation). Vector-born and other dangerous diseases (including malaria), agricultural pests and diseases strong winds and sandstorms, heavy rainfalls, floods and mudflows, high temperature, extreme temperature variation and hot winds derived from climate change are expected to damage agriculture and public health.<br />
<br />
To mitigate such climate change impacts, the proposed approaches are to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. The measures to reduce GHGs (as a fulfilment of UNFCCC obligations) include: enhancement of energy efficiency in relevant sectors of the national economy; application of effective technologies and use of energy sources in the national economy (that promotes high economy growth rate and reduce or limit GHG emissions); protection and enhancement of natural sinks and reservoirs of GHGs; promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation; promotion of sustainable agriculture; development and research on renewable (and new) energies and environmentally sounds technologies for use; and encouragement of appropriate reforms in relevant sectors aimed at promoting policies and measures that reduce GHG emissions.<br />
<br />
Principles and direction of adaptation include: research on climate change and its impact on national resources, economy public health and development of additional adaptation measures; improvement of the systematic observation network and environmental monitoring to renew adaptation measures; improvement of systems to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate data among end users; enhancement of weather forecasting, climate modelling and early warning systems to minimize the risk of natural disasters; capacity building to strengthen institutional, technical and human resources to promote adaptation in the fields of climate change and hydrological research, geographical information systems, environmental impact assessment, protection and re-cultivation of lands rational use of water resources, conservation of ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure development and health protection; and implementation of actual projects on adaptation on priority areas related to rational use of natural resources, economy and health protection.",TJK,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBanNKIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c23ca011d7dc41922fee4a06adc4e85a6e5d338a/f|,executive,06/06/2003|Law passed,Agriculture;Economy-wide;Energy;Environment;Health;LULUCF;Residential and Commercial;Transportation;Water,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Zoning & Spatial Planning|Regulation;Other|Direct Investment;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Research & Development, knowledge generation|Information",Adaptation;Mitigation,Adaptation;Disaster Risk Management,Floods;Droughts;Heatwaves;Glacial Melting,Plan,,,Adaptation;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand,Tajikistan,

1731.0,National Climate Change Policy,"As the document outlines, 'the goal of the policy is to ensure a harmonised and co-ordinated approach towards a climate- resilient and low-carbon development path for sustainable development in Uganda'. The policy notes that the level of knowledge on climate change and its impacts remains low in Uganda. Therefore, it seeks to raise awareness of climate change, targeting sectorial weaknesses (to be determined by different governmental agencies and ministries) in the short term but providing information for a wide variety of stakeholders in the long term.<br />
To this end, the Policy adopts a comprehensive approach to address climate change, identifying as priority concerns: adaptation, mitigation, monitoring, and research. To address these concerns, the Policy promotes the implementation of activities relating to: education and increased awareness; gender issues; promoting and diffusing research; monitoring and transferring knowledge; and institutional capacity building.<br />
The policy calls for the adoption and implementation of a Transport Policy with emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from this sector, especially through the promotion of the use of less carbon intensive fuels. It also stresses the importance of the implementation of the 2007 Renewable Energy Policy and other measures that promote the use and the production of renewables.<br />
The adoption of climate change strategies that address the impact of climate change and promote sustainable activities in the sectors of agriculture and livestock, fishery production, water management, forestry, wetland, biodiversity and ecosystem services and tourism are identified are important needs to develop Uganda's approach to adaption to climate change.<br />
Moreover, the Policy also seeks to implement the basic institutional structure required to finance this awareness raising campaign and to develop a performance measurement framework for each ministry and agency involved. The policy also strengthens the Climate Change Unit, upgrading it to a National Climate Change Commission with a more advanced legal and institutional framework that can co-ordinate climate change policy across sectors and regions. The Policy Committee on Environment is also strengthened to help guide climate change policy implementation.<br />
As annex to the Climate Change Policy, the Cost Implementation Strategy provides a more detailed account on the implementation of the Policy, including an indicative costing for the programmes and activities to be developed.

1733.0,The Renewable Energy Policy for Uganda,"The Renewable Energy Policy follows the commitment in the National Energy Policy 2002 to develop the use of renewable energy resources in Uganda. The Government's overarching policy vision for renewable energy is to make modern renewable energy a substantial part of national energy consumption, where modern renewable energy is understood to mean renewable energy resources that are transformed into modern energy services like electricity.<br />
To achieve its goal, a number of supporting objectives are identified. These include: maintaining and improving the responsiveness of the legal and institutional framework to promote renewable energy investments; establishing an financing and fiscal policy framework for investments in renewable energy; increasing public awareness in renewable energy and promoting investment in this area; promoting research and development as well as international co-operation in renewable energy technologies (RETs); utilizing biomass energy efficiently and sustainably; and promoting the conversion of municipal and industrial waste to energy.<br />
Various strategies and policy actions are elaborated in order to achieve these objectives. A power generation programme will support public and private sector investments in renewable energy, focussing on large hydropower schemes (hydropower being the most well developed RET) as well as small and more diverse schemes. A rural and urban-poor electricity access programme will support the development of RETs in dispersed and remote settlements. A modern energy services programme will support RETs such as solar PV and solar water heaters, a biofuels programme will support improvements in biofuel technology, and a waste for energy programmes will support the conversion of waste to energy. An energy efficiency programmes will implement the Uganda Energy Efficiency Strategy.<br />
<br />
The responsibility for the policy lies with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and a Renewable Energy Department is to be developed within the Ministry. Moreover, a special financial mechanism, a credit support facility known as the Uganda Energy Capitalisation Trust, is instituted to help realise the policy.

<br />
The Plan sets out how the UK will achieve decarbonisation within the framework of energy policy - making a transition to a low carbon economy while maintaining energy security and minimising costs to consumers (particularly those in poorer households).<br />
<br />
The Plan sets out proposals and policies to meet the UK's first four carbon budgets, each lasting five years with increasing emissions reductions targets. The fourth budget, for the period 2023-2027, requires emissions to be reduced by 50% compared to 1990 levels.<br />
<br />
The plan includes 5 sectoral plans, covering measures to be taken during this decade and in the 2020s:<br />
- Low carbon buildings, including energy efficiency and low carbon heating<br />
- Low carbon transport<br />
- Low carbon industry<br />
- Low carbon electricity<br />
- Agriculture, land use, forestry and waste<br />
<br />
The government will support up to 1.5 million solid wall insulations and other energy efficiency measures, introduce zero-carbon home standards to support energy efficiency improvements. It will also support over 130,000 low carbon heat installations by 2020 and work with local authorities to support district heating networks. The Plan sets out that emissions from buildings should be 24%-39% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br />
<br />
The government will support the market roll-out of ultra-low emission vehicles and the take-up of other lower carbon travel methods (walking, cycling, public transport), with the aim that transport emissions should be 17%-28% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br />
Emissions from industry will be reduced by 20%-24% compared to 2009 levels by 2027, through a mix of energy efficiency measures, low carbon fuel use, EU ETS membership, and CCS development.<br />
<br />
By 2027, emissions from electricity should be 75%-84% lower than 2009 levels. These reductions will come from increasing use of gas and renewables instead of coal, the introduction of Contacts for Difference in feed-in tariffs, and support for renewables development, CCS development, and reductions in the cost of offshore wind. The Plan does not set any specific technology or decarbonisation targets, and supports the lowest cost mix of nuclear, renewables and CCS use by 2027.<br />

1759.0,Code for Sustainable Homes,"Building on the recommendations of the Sustainable Buildings Task Group, the Code was developed to support a step change in the building of sustainable new homes. The Code provides a single national standard to guide industry in the design and construction of sustainable homes, considering energy among other aspects.<br />
<br />
Since 2007 the developer of any new home in England can choose to be assessed against the Code. From 2008 it was mandatory for all new homes to be rated against the Code and to include a Code or nil-rated certificate within the Home Information Pack. Even though the requirement for the Home Information Pack for property sales was suspended in 2010, an Energy Performance Certificate is still required.<br />
<br />
There are six levels of the Code, with mandatory minimum standards for energy efficiency at each level. Level 1 represents a 10% improvement in energy efficiency over the 2006 Building Regulations. Level 6 would be a completely zero-carbon home (heating, lighting, hot water and all appliances).<br />
<br />
Improvements in the energy efficiency of new homes of more than 25% compared to 2006 regulations (Level 3 of the code) would probably require some form of low- or zero-carbon energy generation, either by individual buildings (eg dedicated solar water heating) or by whole developments sharing a source of low carbon generation (eg wind turbines).",GBR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbHdJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--0a074cfe7db2b22929ef7bc28faef6234d1d0310/f|,executive,25/12/2006|Law passed,Energy;Industry;Residential and Commercial;Transportation;Water,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Policy,,,Energy Demand,United Kingdom,

<br />
The reform was intended to remove the perverse incentive in the existing system to reduce the tax due by driving unnecessary extra business miles and to provide a significant incentive to company cars drivers to choose more fuel-efficient vehicles.<br />
<br />
To further promote environmentally friendly vehicles, the government introduced a progressive percentage charge rate system.

8475.0,Clean Growth Strategy,"&nbsp;The Clean Growth Strategy exposes how the Government intends to foster national income while reducing greenhouse gases emissions, and do so at the least possible cost for taxpayers while maximising the social and economic benefits. The Strategy comes in line with the commitment made under the 2008 Climate Change Act that requires the country to reduce its emissions ""by at least 80% by 2050"". The Strategy acknowledges that efforts to reduce emissions will have to significantly ramp up in order to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets (covering the periods 2023-2027 and 2028-2032). Beyond setting up the strategy to 2032, the document explores electrification, hydrogen and emissions removal as three pathways to 2050.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Strategy firstly highlights the image of leadership and situation of progress that the country has made in the last two decades. It details the economic opportunities brought by the Paris Agreement for its low-carbon industries, notably thanks to its academic strength, expertise in high-value service and financial industries and stable regulatory framework. According to the document, the low carbon sector could grow by around 11% a year on the period 2015-2030, or four times faster than the overall economy, and ""could deliver between £60 billion and £170 billion of export sales of goods and services by 2030"". The document also mentions the co-benefits of actions to reduce greenhouse gases emissions on local air quality, public health, the economy and the environment. The Strategy also recalls the objective of energy affordability and the fact that leaving the EU represents an opportunity as ""domestic binding emissions targets are more ambitious than those set by EU legislation"".<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A number of more precise objectives are detailed as following: 1) develop green finance capabilities, including by setting up a green finance taskforce and providing up to £20 million to support a new clean technology early stage investment fund,- 2) develop a package of measures to support businesses to improve their energy productivity, by at least 20% by 2030,- 3) improving energy efficiency and aiming at reducing emissions from homes by 19% and energy use by 9%,- 4) rolling out low carbon heating,- 5) accelerate the shift to low carbon transport and reduce emissions by 29% by relying mostly on electric vehicles,- 6) deliver clean, smart, flexible power,- 7)enhance the benefits and value of domestic natural resources,- 8) and lead in the public sector. The government also commits £2.5 billion of investment in transport (33% of the total), power, cross-sector, smart systems, homes, business and industry, land use and waste.",GBR,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbWtHIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--205198130a32d7d4c2f577d6e5d072120897e165/f|en,executive,12/10/2017|Approved||,Economy-wide;Energy;Health;Industry;LULUCF;Transportation;Waste,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Strategy,,,Adaptation;Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Transportation,United Kingdom,

1777.0,Clean Air Act,"The Clean Air Act is a federal law designed to control air pollution on a national level. It requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to airborne contaminants that are known to be hazardous to human health and/or welfare.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Congress passed the first Clean Air Act in 1963, creating a research and regulatory programme in the US Public Health Service. The Act authorised development of emission standards for stationary sources. In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established four new regulatory programmes:<br>&nbsp;- National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) - EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation)<br>&nbsp;- State Implementation Plans (SIPs)<br>&nbsp;- New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)<br>&nbsp;- National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection. The EPA's 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011.

2021.0,"Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016","The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed into law on 18 December 2015, renews tax credit programs for wind and solar electricity generation and incorporates a phase-out schedule for these support programs, providing some stability for the renewable energy market.<br />
The Act extends the 'production tax credit' (PTC) for wind facilities provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code per kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity production for facilities beginning construction before 1 January 2020. This change applies retroactively from 1 January 2015 (when the previous guarantee for PTC originally expired). The Act also includes a phase-out provision, under which the volume of PTC depends on beginning of the construction of the wind facilities: 20% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2017, 40% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2018, and 60% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2019.<br />
The Act allows wind facilities brought into service before 1 January 2020 to choose the 'investment tax credit' (ITC) program, based upon a percentage of each energy property brought into service during any taxable year, instead of the PTC program. The ITC program applies similar percentage-based phase-out support as the PTC program.<br />
The Act extends the ITC program for solar energy until 2021, with a percentage-based phase-out provision. The energy credit reduces from 30% to 26% percent for facilities upon which construction begins after 31 December 2019 and further to 22% percent for facilities upon which construction begins after 31 December 2020. It is estimated that the solar ITC provision of the Act will add '220,000 new jobs by 2020, cut 100 million tons of emissions, and lead to $133 billion invested in the U.S. economy' (http://www.seia.org/news/seia-celebrates-extension-itc).",USA,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaFVJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--4a8bafaf40dd7e634c634ccc85723814bc6b2db0/f|,legislative,18/12/2015|Law passed,Economy-wide;Energy,"Capacity building|Governance;Subnational and citizen participation|Governance;Education, training and knowledge dissemination|Information",,Mitigation,,Law,,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Energy Supply,United States of America,
2035.0,Electrify Africa Act,"The law legislates the US initiative and goal to provide access to power for at least 50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020, and to enable the installation of an additional 20,000 megawatts of electricity capacity by 2020.<br />
The law supports a broad variety of power generation options, including oil, coal and natural gas, hydroelectric power, wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable sources of power, as well as energy efficiency and distribution and transmission systems upgrades. The Electricity Africa Act however particularly promotes renewable energy projects, as the law requires the U.S. government to promote the spread of distributed renewable energy in sub-Saharan Africa, including off-grid lighting and power. The priority given to off-grid generation is an endorsement of existing efforts, already carried out by a sub-initiative of Power Africa Initiative (see below).<br />
To create lasting infrastructures, the law seeks to promote policies to facilitate private financing and public-private partnerships, allow independent producers' participation in electricity markets, and encourage other regulatory reforms in the power sector. The law calls on the US to partner with sub-Saharan African countries, international and regional financial institutions and the private sector to meet the above goals and implement a strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.<br />
The Electricity Africa Act does not allocate new funds to the US agencies, but builds on and backs the <a href=""https://www.dlapiper.com/en/china/insights/publications/2013/07/us-commits-$7b-to-ambitious-power-africa-initiat__/"">Power Africa Initiative</a>, launched in 2013 with a goal of doubling access to electricity across sub-Saharan Africa. The Initiative commits the US to US$7 billion support to the energy sector in sub-Saharan Africa.<br />
The law requires the President of the U.S. to submit to the US Senate, within 6 months of the law's enactment, a report outlining a multiyear strategy for reaching the objectives of the law.<br />
The Electricity Africa Act also directs U.S. government agencies, such as US Agency for International Development (USAID), the US Trade and Development Agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, to prioritize loans, grants and technical support for power generation and transmission projects in sub-Saharan Africa.

Within primary sector development, climate change is identified as a key issue and challenge under the area of the environment and disaster management, and the agenda notes that lack of resources is constraining the full implementation of the Environmental Management and Conservation Act. Climate change is also noted as a factor under the need to provide adequate support services (infrastructure and utilities), and the need to build climate change issues into National Development Plans is specifically noted.",VUT,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBa1lJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--299c53a2c366fc4de2bfedf856186ef568cc758f/f|,executive,01/06/2006|Law passed,Health,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation",,Adaptation;Disaster Risk Management,,Policy,,,Adaptation,Vanuatu,
1787.0,Forestry Rights Registration and Timber Harvest Guarantee Act No. 28,"The Act regulates the definition, granting, transfer and registration of forestry rights in Vanuatu, and the harvesting and accreditation of timber plantations. It enables a proprietor of a lease (as registered under the Land Leases Act) to grant a forestry right over the land covered by the lease.<br />
<br />
The definition of forestry right includes a carbon sequestration right which is defined as ‘a right conferred by agreement or otherwise to the legal, commercial or other benefit (whether present or future) of carbon sequestration by any existing or future tree or forest on the land'. The Act therefore establishes a separate property right that enables carbon rights to be decoupled from land rights (and thus provides for the allocation of carbon rights). However, while almost all land in Vanuatu is held under customary tenure, only approximately 9% is leased, with a further 90% unleased. Therefore the majority of landholders will not be able to exercise similar rights to forest carbon.<br />

The Act was amended in 2012 (the Forestry Rights Registration and Timber Harvest Guarantee (Amendment) Act No. 8 of 2012) to include reference to sandalwood products.",VUT,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBa0VJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--070d965a6b4621734241443bb43768dc5f01fd49/f|,legislative,09/10/2000|Law passed,LULUCF;Residential and Commercial;Transportation,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Law,,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Redd+ And Lulucf,Vanuatu,
2030.0,Vanuatu Framework for Climate Services,"<br />
<br />
The <a href=""http://www.wmo.int/gfcs/sites/default/files/Vanuatu%20Framework%20for%20Climate%20Services.pdf"">Vanuatu Framework for Climate Services </a>was developed by the Ministry of Climate Change to serve as basis for development of climate strategies to manage and adapt to climate change through sustainable and accessible climate services. The framework is consistent with the <a href=""http://adaptation-undp.org/projects/vanuatu-national-adaptation-programme-action-napa"">Vanuatu National Adaptation Plan for Action</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nab.vu/vanuatu-climate-change-and-disaster-risk-reduction-policy-2016-2030"">Vanuatu Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy 2016 to 2030</a>, <a href=""https://www.un.int/vanuatu/vanuatu/sustainable-development"">Vanuatu National Sustainable Development Goals</a> and the <a href=""http://www.sprep.org/publications/pacific-islands-meteorological-strategy-2012-2021"">Pacific Islands Meteorological Strategy</a>.<br />
The Framework identifies users of climate services, information needs and appropriate mechanisms for dissemination and communication of climate information, and highlights gaps and needs to be addressed in the short- and medium term.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The framework also provides a list of 18 recommended actions and activities to strengthen climate information development, provision, understanding and use throughout Vanuatu. A Roadmap for Strengthening Climate Services is also included, suggesting prioritisation, time frames and indicative costs associated with the recommendations.",VUT,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBZ3dJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--40d3aa652c72879f053f1a95803210d08da72e70/f|,executive,01/07/2016|Law passed,,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Adaptation;Disaster Risk Management,,Policy,,,Adaptation,Vanuatu,

The country initiated this process with the establishment of the National Advisory Board on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction in 2012. It is a broad set of measures based on accountability, sustainability, equity, community focus, collaboration, and innovation.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The policy insists on 1) establishing appropriate governance and strengthen institutional structures so they can effectively tackle the tasks they are pursuing, 2) to ensure that adequate resourcing is available for climate change and disaster risk reduction activities, notably via the implementation of entity accreditation and small grants schemes, 3) ensure that traditional knowledge and existing and new information such as data analysis, research and risk assessment are shared, 4) adaptation and disaster risk reduction, integrating the two targets and adopting community and ecosystem-based approaches to protect and economically assess losses, 5) low carbon development via an energy roadmap, renewable energy and energy efficiency, but also from a reduction in deforestation and land degradation, 6) and preparedness, planning, response and recovery to disasters by ensuring community awareness, early warning systems.<br>&nbsp;<br>The document also insists on capacity building, gender and social inclusion, multi-hazard approach and partnerships with a vast array of stakeholders. Implementation of the plan must be realised by integrating it into corporate and business plans, monitoring and evaluating the policy by the National Advisory Board on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (NAB), and reporting by NAB.

10343.0,Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,"The current Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was passed in 1999. The National Electoral Council reported tonight that 71% of votes were in favor of the new charter while 28.79 percent were against it. The turnout was 44.4% of Venezuela's 11 million registered voters; this low turnout was attributed to a certain extent to torrential rains around the period that the referendum took place. This Constitution has since been amended once, in 2009. In 2017, Maduro’s government started moving towards creating a new Constitution, although this caused widespread objection objections and it still has not led to a new charter to replace the 1999 Constitution. Within the current Constitution’s environmental rights chapter, Chapter IX, develops a right to sustainable development and establishes that the State shall protect a series of environmental areas. Moreover, article 127 establishes a fundamental duty of the State to ensure a pollution-free environment where climate, among other environmental topics, receives special protection. This provision states the following: “It is the right and duty of each generation to protect and maintain the environment for its own benefit and that of the world of the future. Everyone has the right, individually and collectively, to enjoy a safe, healthful and ecologically balanced life and environment. The State shall protect the environment, biological and genetic diversity, ecological processes, national parks and natural monuments, and other areas of particular ecological importance.

The demand side section of the policy highlights the issues in the context of the five demand sectors: agriculture, industry and mining, commerce and services, transport and households (both urban and rural). Focuses include the efficient use of energy in carrying out economic activities and promoting of fuel-wood substation. The supply side refers to the use of coal, petroleum products, electricity, gas and renewable energy. It calls for the sustainable use of biomass resources (e.g. wood fuel, industrial waste such as bagasse and pulp), hydropower, solar power and wind power. Hydropower is currently contributing to the national grid, and the document identifies its potential contribution to rural power needs. It also promises that the underutilized solar power will be developed, both for solar electricity and solar heat. Policy measures specific to renewable energy includes: to adopt a long-term government-driven, renewable energy technologies (RETs) programme, which encourages IPPS and public-private partnerships to harness sustainable RETs; to institute innovative funding mechanisms and finance opportunities such as Clean Development Mechanisms, feed-in-tariffs and micro-credit institutions for RETs; to institute RETs-sustainable capacity building programmes; to raise awareness about the benefits and opportunities of renewable energy; to encourage local production and the commercialisation of technologies; to strengthen the institutional framework for research and development and the promotion of renewable energy technologies; to promote investment into standalone solar energy systems to cater four rural communities; to promote efficient use of biomass for cooking; to encourage the use of waste biomass for energy purposes; and to develop incentives for investment in renewable energy (such as subsidies and tax concessions).",ZWE,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBakFJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--61e66a952cbded7007bc861d54e90d86f13452a7/f|,executive,25/12/2012|Approved||,Agriculture;Economy-wide;Energy;Industry;Residential and Commercial;Transportation;Urban;Waste,"Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Education, training and knowledge dissemination|Information",,Mitigation,,Policy,,,Energy Supply;Energy Demand,Zimbabwe,

1298.0,Governmental Decree No.2019 of 2008 adopting the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan,"This Decree adopts the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP). The first NEEAP outlined the existing planned energy efficiency measures to decrease the energy consumption by 1% annually during the nine years between 2008 and 2016. The objectives of the NEEAP I are as follows: alignment of Hungary's energy policy initiatives with those of the EU; finding the most cost-effective solutions for utilization of energy-saving potential; shaping consumer awareness and influencing the market in order to achieve long-term energy efficiency; informing market players of the structure and time frame of the plans; realization of the EU's energy efficiency expectations of member states; and consideration of climate protection aspects. According to the NEEAP and the Governmental decree No.64 of 2009, the Ministry of National Development (former Ministry of Transport, Telecommunication and Energy) is responsible for the preparation of NEEAPs. Co-ordination of the implementation of NEEAP and the verification of its progress falls under the responsibility of the Energy Centre, a government-owned energy efficiency, environment and energy information agency non-profit company. It is the national agency responsible for energy efficiency and renewable energy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Plan also notes that actions including the following could further save energy:extension of state aid to upgrade household appliances and lightbulbs; state aid to develop energy saving awareness activities; making the use of energy efficient office equipment obligatory; promotion of the dissemination of energy-saving building technologies; and strengthening the energy aspect of environmental and traffic safety considerations in connection with the import of used vehicles.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The NEEAP was modified in 2010 under the Governmental Decision No.1076 of 2010 on the Modified National Energy Efficiency Action Plan of Hungary (MNEEAP) and the second NEEAP (NEEAP II) was adopted under the Governmental Decision No.1374 of 2011. The NEEAP II includes shortcomings and an action plan aiming to solve them, national energy saving targets and measures in energy end-use, sectoral measures for energy saving and institutions responsible for implementation and monitoring.

- Knowledge economy: developing a competitive knowledge economy through value addition<br />
- Connectivity: modernising transport infrastructure and regional connectivity.<br />
<br />
While the overall direction of the document is development of the country, climate change is considered as one of the challenges the country would face that requires mitigation and adaptation. Pakistan's vulnerabilities are seen as an important challenge of its transition towards a high level of sustained growth. Following vulnerabilities and challenges are mentioned in the document:<br />
- Water security: current water availability is less than 1,100 cubic meters per person, down from 5,000 cubic meters in 1951; Pakistan's water storage capacity is limited to 30 days<br />
- Food security: Pakistan ranks 76th of the 107 countries on the Global Food Security Index<br />
- Glacial melt: Indus basin (water reservoir) affected by the glaciers in the Hindukush-Karakoram and Himalayas<br />
- Biodiversity threat caused by climate change: habitat destruction and alteration, biotechnology (such as basmati rice, turmeric and neem) and threats of genetically modified seeds and germplasm to indigenous species<br />
- Energy security: alternative energy<br />
- Institutions that favour the status quo<br />
- Infrastructure bottleneck.<br />
<br />
The Vision 2025 stands upon the target fulfilment of the MDGs and SDGs by 2030. The document also sets out 25 goals in accordance to the 7 pillars. The goals that are related to the purpose of this study are as follows:<br />

<br />
This new version keeps the target of a 40% decrease of energy intensity of the economy between 2007 and 2020, but alters the 4.5% share of electricity generation from renewable energy sources target to 2.5% by 2020 (excluding large hydro over 25 MW). The Programme calls for diverse measures to attain those targets, including:<br />
- evaluating the technological and economic potential of efficient renewables use<br />
- providing subsidies from the state budget in order to compensate for the costs of grid connection for renewables<br />
- installation of smart meters (18.9% of metering devices by 2020)<br />
- increasing the availability of energy infrastructure - reducing the number of steps required to gain access to the grid (from 8 to 5) and reducing the delay of connection to the grid (from 276 to 40 days)<br />
- raising public awareness on energy conservation and energy efficiency.<br />

1605.0,Rwanda Vision 2020,"Vision 2020 is a framework for Rwanda's development, presenting the key priorities and providing Rwandans with a guiding tool for the future. It seeks to transform Rwanda into a middle-income country by the year 2020. This will require achieving annual per capita income of USD900 (USD290 today), a poverty rate of 30% (64% today) and an average life expectance of 55 years (49 years today).<br />
<br />
The framework includes the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure as a crucial aspect in lowering the costs of doing business. It calls for: (i) a modern land law providing security of tenure and freedom of exchange; (ii) the development of alternative lower costs of transport to the sea; and (iii) increase of energy production and diversification into alternative energy sources. Rwanda has considerable hydroelectric potential, in addition to large deposits of renewable methane gas in Lake Kivu, estimated at 60bn m3. In rural areas direct solar energy or photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155m tons of peat deposit is currently exploitable. Rwanda projects that by 2020, at least 35% of the population will be connected to electricity (up from the current 6%).<br />
<br />
Vision 2020 recognises sustainable environmental and climate change management as a cross-cutting pivotal area to the realisation of national aspirations. It recognises that the major problem in environmental protection is the imbalance between the population and the natural resources. This leads to alarming degradation observed through massive deforestation, the depletion of biodiversity, erosion and landslides, pollution of waterways and the degradation of fragile ecosystems.<br />
<br />
To protect the environment against massive deforestation and soil destruction, Vision 2020 sets the target for the protection rate against erosion to rise from 20% in 2000 to 90% by year 2020. To ease the pressure on wood biomass seeing that 86.3% of the Rwandan population uses wood as the source of energy, Vision 2020 targets to drop the use of wood energy in national energy balance, to 50% by 2020 through diversification of energy sources availed to the population.",RWA,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdDRJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--cdb6779e4374d0d21f7e4e9c6678ee8854c3d70c/f|,executive,01/07/2000|Law passed,Energy;Environment;LULUCF;Transportation;Water,"Other|Direct Investment;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,Mitigation,,Vision,,,Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Redd+ And Lulucf;Transportation,Rwanda,

All self-consumers connected to the grid (see below) have to be registered with the Registry for Electrical Energy Self-Consumption, even if they do not ever intend on selling any surplus energy that they generate to the grid (isolated facilities exempt).<br />
There are two self-consumption modalities:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>'supply with self-consumption' - consumer with a contracted power of maximum 100 kW, owning at least one generation facility within its internal network, not registered as production facility</li><br />
<li>'production with self-consumption' - consumer associated to at least one generation facility connected within its network; the total power of the production facilities must be lower or equal to the consumer contracted power</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Decree allows for electricity storage devices installed within the self-consumption facilities, but makes them financially unattractive.<br />
All self-consumers have to pay 'access tolls' to the grid to contribute to its maintenance and operations. Tolls depend on the real use of the grid (contracted power and energy introduced in the border point). Under the second modality, 'access tolls' for feeding energy to the network are to be paid. In addition, all self-consumers have to pay the ""charges associated to the electricity system cost"", as well as the 'charge for other services of the system' (i.e. back-up of the self-consumer's facilities provided by the electrical system; can vary or be exempt for non-mainland territories and low voltage consumers - under 10 kW). Some existing facilities (e.g. cogeneration, small generation of <50 MW) are temporarily exempt from the charges until 31 December 2019.<br />
Both types of self-consumers can purchase additional electricity. However, only facilities registered under the second modality are entitled to receive a financial compensation for providing electricity to the grid.
