                Anonymous data about usage (eg number of visitors, visitors'
                country, number of times each page is visited) is collected and
                aggregated to produce website performance reports.

                your IP address, device information, browser type and settings
                and information about your activity on the Website (such as the

                Location Data. We collect location data such as information
                about your device's location, which can be either precise or
                imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type
                and settings of the device you use to access the Website. For
                example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
                geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on
                your IP address). You can opt-out of allowing us to collect this
                information either by refusing access to the information or by
                disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you
                choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of
                the Services.
