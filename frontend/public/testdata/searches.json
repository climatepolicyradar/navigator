      "document_description": "The policy recognizes that climate change contributes significantly to Kenya's increasing vulnerability to disasters in the last two decades and affects seriously the lives and livelihoods of communities. The policy therefore aims to institutionalise mechanisms to address these disasters and associated vulnerabilities stressing the central role of climate change in any sustainable and integrated National Strategy for Disaster Management.\u00a0\u00a0The policy emphasises preparedness on the part of the government, communities and other stakeholders and proposes to establish and strengthen Disaster Management institutions, partnerships and networking. It proposes to mainstream Disaster Risk Reduction in the development process and strengthen the resilience of vulnerable groups.\u00a0\u00a0Disaster Risk Management encompasses a full continuum from preparedness, relief and rehabilitation, mitigation and prevention including t diversification of vulnerable livelihoods and coping mechanisms. Ministry of State for Special Programmes in the Office of President is appointed as the chief national co-ordinator.",

For example:\u00a0- Reducing primary energy intensity by 10% compared to 2008 by 2015\u00a0Limiting GHG emissions from coal-fired electricity production, by using cleaner technologies and taking efficiency-increasing measures by increasing the average cycle efficiencies of existing coal-fired thermal power plants until 2023\u00a0- Issuing 'Energy Performance Certificates' to all buildings until 2017\u00a0- Decreasing annual energy consumption in the buildings and premises of public institutions by 10% until 2015 and by 20% until 2023\u00a0- At least 20% of the annual energy demand of new buildings will be met via renewable energy resources as of 2017\u00a0- Reducing GHG emissions in new settlements by at least 10% in comparison with existing settlements (which are selected as pilot regions and the GHG emissions of which are identified until 2015) until 2023.\u00a0\u00a0Forestry\u00a0- Increase forest carbon sequestration by 15% of 2007 value until 2020 ( 14,500 Gg by 2007, 16,700 Gg by 2020)\u00a0- Reduce deforestation and forest damage by 20% compared to 2007 values by 2020\u00a0\u00a0Land use change\u00a0- Integrate climate change in land use and land use changes management strategies by 2015\u00a0- Increase the amount of sequestered carbon in agricultural forestry activities by 10% by 2020 compared to 2007 values\u00a0- Quantify the carbon stored in pastures and meadows in 2012. Increase this by 3% by 2020\u00a0\u00a0Transportation\u00a0The plan aims to ensure the balanced use of types of passenger and freight transportation, specifically:\u00a0- Increasing the share of railroads in freight transportation from 5% in 2009 to 15%, and in passenger transportation from 2% in 2009 to 10% by 2023\u00a0- Increasing by 2023, the share of seaways in freight transportation from 2.66% of tonne/km in 2009 to 10%, and in passenger transportation from 0.37% in passenger/km in 2009 to 4%,\u00a0- Decreasing by 2023 the share of highways in freight transportation from 80.63% of tonne/km in 2009 to below 60%, and in passenger transportation from 89.59% in passenger/km in 2009 to 72%\u00a0- Developing the necessary legislation, institutional structure and guidance documents until the end of 2023 for implementation of sustainable transportation planning in cities\u00a0- Dissemination of the use of alternative fuels and clean vehicle technologies in the transportation sector by making legal arrangements and building capacity to increase use of alternative fuels and clean vehicles until 2023\u00a0- Increasing efficiency in energy consumption of transportation sector by limiting energy consumption in transportation until 2023.\u00a0\u00a0Adaptation objectives:\u00a0\u00a0- Integrating adaptation to the impacts of climate change into water resource management policies\u00a0\u00a0- Strengthening water resources management capacity, interagency cooperation and coordination with regard to adaptation to climate change\u00a0\u00a0- Develop and expand R&D and scientific studies to ensure adaptation to the impacts of climate change in water resources management\u00a0\u00a0- Integrated management of water resources and water basins for adaptation to climate change\u00a0\u00a0- Planning renewable energy resources taking into consideration the impacts of climate change and the sustainability of the ecosystem services oriented to increase resilience to climate change",
