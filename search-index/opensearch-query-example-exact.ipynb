       "           'action_description': \"The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals.

       "           'action_description': \"The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

It implies a small reduction in overall GHG emissions by 2020, and a 4% increase between 2020 and 2030. The document presents a sectoral strategy aiming to address the key challenges that the Polish power industry must faces until 2030, including growing demand for energy, inadequate fuel, energy generation and transmission infrastructure, significant dependence on external supplies of natural gas and almost full complete dependence on external supplies of crude oil, as well as commitments in the field of environmental protection, including climate protection. The new Energy Policy for Poland until 2050, which will reflect the decisions made on the EU 2030 climate policy, is under preparation.\\xa0\\xa0The document establishes a number of measures addressing energy demand, including national energy efficiency targets, energy efficiency performance certificates, minimum standards for power-consuming products, supporting investments in energy saving, and applying demand-side management techniques.\\xa0\\xa0It also establishes that energy supply should consist of a mix between cogeneration, renewables, grid modernisation, and nuclear. With this end, the EPP fixes measurable targets, for example: increase the percentage of renewable energy sources to 15% by 2020 and to 20% by 2030; boost the share of biofuels in the transportation fuels market to 10%; and building of at least one biogas agricultural plant in each commune by 2020.\\xa0\\xa0The EPP 2030 strategy document establishes the need to gradually increase the share of bio-components fuel in transportation fuels so as to meet planned objectives. As a result, the government established differentiated fuel taxes in a way that to promotes alternative fuels.PEP 2040 was officially released on September 8, 2020.

A key output from the OREDP is the identification of ways to ensure the optimal coordination of a wide range of government departments, agencies and state bodies that are critical enablers for offshore wind and ocean energy development. The Plan identifies the next steps that must be taken to support the sustainable realisation of the economic potential of offshore renewable energy resources.\\nTaking into account a number of energy, economic development and environmental issues, the Plan identifies ten policy and enabling actions, along with responsible bodies and completion timeframes, which are key to the development of the offshore renewable energy sector: (i) put in place a robust governance structure; (ii) increase exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration; (iii) introduce initial market support tariff for ocean energy; (iv) develop renewable electricity export markets; (v) develop the supply chain for the offshore renewable energy industry; (vi) communicate that Ireland is open for business; (vii) explore potential for international collaboration; (viii) introduce a new planning and consent architecture for development in the marine area; (ix) put in place a number of mitigation measures to protect the environment; and (x) ensure appropriate infrastructure development.\",\n",

That plan comes under the Physical Planning Act 2003.\\n\\nThe National Physical Development Plan (NPDP) stems from the Physical Planning Act of 2003. It is meant to provide a strategic, national spatial development framework that addresses current development issues, and provides a platform for feasible private and public sector development initiatives, reflecting local cultural values and aspirations over the next twenty years. The Sustainable Island Resource Management Zoning Plan (SIRMZP) of 2012 is itself designed to serve as a revised NPDP that meets the criteria of the Physical Planning Act.\\n\\nThe SIRMZP seeks more specific options to optimise the productive use of environmental resources while protecting critical ecosystems and promoting the local economic development, notably in the tourism, services, agriculture and industrial sectors. It does so by providing geographic and sectoral analysis to suggest low-carbon development scenarios forward, and climate change adaptation measures such as minimum ground floor elevation.',\n",

The ultimate goal envisioned is for Pakistan to be one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2047. The following pillars of the vision meet elements of the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs):\\n- People first: developing social and human capital and empowering women\\n- Growth: sustained, indigenous, and inclusive growth\\n- Governance: democratic governance - institutional reform and modernisation of the public sector\\n- Security: energy, water and food security\\n- Entrepreneurship: private sector and entrepreneurship-led growth\\n- Knowledge economy: developing a competitive knowledge economy through value addition\\n- Connectivity: modernising transport infrastructure and regional connectivity.\\n\\nWhile the overall direction of the document is development of the country, climate change is considered as one of the challenges the country would face that requires mitigation and adaptation. Pakistan's vulnerabilities are seen as an important challenge of its transition towards a high level of sustained growth. Following vulnerabilities and challenges are mentioned in the document:\\n- Water security: current water availability is less than 1,100 cubic meters per person, down from 5,000 cubic meters in 1951; Pakistan's water storage capacity is limited to 30 days\\n- Food security: Pakistan ranks 76th of the 107 countries on the Global Food Security Index\\n- Glacial melt: Indus basin (water reservoir) affected by the glaciers in the Hindukush-Karakoram and Himalayas\\n- Biodiversity threat caused by climate change: habitat destruction and alteration, biotechnology (such as basmati rice, turmeric and neem) and threats of genetically modified seeds and germplasm to indigenous species\\n- Energy security: alternative energy\\n- Institutions that favour the status quo\\n- Infrastructure bottleneck.\\n\\nThe Vision 2025 stands upon the target fulfilment of the MDGs and SDGs by 2030. The document also sets out 25 goals in accordance to the 7 pillars. The goals that are related to the purpose of this study are as follows:\\n- Double power generation to over 45,000MW, to provide uninterrupted and affordable electricity\\n- Increase access to electricity from 67% to 90% of the population\\n- Improve generation mix (15%) and reduce distribution losses (10%) to reduce average cost per unit by over 25%\\n- Increase the share of indigenous sources of power generation to over 50%\\n- Address demand management by increasing usage of energy efficient appliances and products to 80%\\n- Increase water storage capacity to 90 days\\n- Improve water use efficiency in agriculture by 20%\\n- Ensure access to clean drinking water for all citizens\\n- Reduce food insecure population from 60% to 30%.\",\n",
