It also contains references to the long-term direction of travel until 2035. The plan was released and ratified by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. The plan reiterates the previously announced target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and sets a goal of seeing emissions peak in 2030.\\xa0The most critical provision in the plan concerning climate is Article XXVIII, which contains a section entitled ‘Actively respond to climate change”, but various other provisions also touch on climate issues.\\xa0 Relevant provisions are summarised below:\\xa0Article III: Main Goals\\xa0Section 1 of Article 3 sets out China’s long-term goals until 2035. It includes an emphasis on “green modes of production” and notes that “carbon emissions will decline steadily after reaching a peak”. More detailed objectives are set out in Section 2, which reads: “Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5% and 18% respectively, total emissions of the main pollutants will continue to fall, and the rate of forest coverage will increase to 24.1%.

It includes the goal of increasing “the proportion of non-fossil energy in total energy consumption to about 20%.” The section also includes provisions for the development of coal power and oil and gas exploration, although plans to develop coal will be subject to controls and where possible coal will be replaced with electricity.\\xa0References are also made to improved flood control and prevention mechanisms and to improved rail transportation.\\xa0Article XXIX Comprehensively Improve Urban Quality\\xa0This article describes plans to create green, low-carbon cities and urban flood control systems.\\xa0Article XXXI on the implementation of major regional strategies Section 2 of this article states that China will adhere to ecological priority and sustainable development, and cooperate to promote environmental protection. Section 5 states that the country will seek to \"reasonably control the intensity of coal development, promote the integrated development and utilisation of energy resources, and strengthen the ecological restoration of mines.\"Article XXXII on the implementation of coordinated development strategies at the regional scale This article states under section 5 that the country will promote the comprehensive management of ecologically degraded areas and the protection and restoration of ecologically fragile areas and support the construction of the Bijie Pilot Area.Article XXXIII Actively expand the space for maritime economic development\\xa0This article contains provisions regarding protection of the marine environment, wetland conservation, and the maintenance of at least 25% of natural shoreline.Article XXXVII Improve the quality and stability of ecosystemsThis article contains references to eco-system repair and protection, and in particular goals to increase forest cover, engage in greening programmes, prevent soil erosion, and “increase the wetland protection rate to 55%”.Article XXVIII Continue to improve environmental quality\\xa0This article contains the most important climate provisions in the plan.\\xa0Section 4 of this article is titled “actively respond to climate change”. The section notes that China will formulate an action plan to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030. It includes plans to “implement a system that focuses on carbon intensity control with a secondary focus on total carbon emission control and support qualified localities, key industries, and key enterprises in taking the lead in reaching peak carbon emissions.” It also suggests plans to “increase controls on other greenhouse gases such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons” and “improve the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem” to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

       "           'action_description': 'The 14th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China\\'s development for 2021-2025 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. Like previous five-year plans, the 14th Five Year plan sets out the direction of travel for China’s climate action over the period 2021 - 2025. It also contains references to the long-term direction of travel until 2035. The plan was released and ratified by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. The plan reiterates the previously announced target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and sets a goal of seeing emissions peak in 2030.\\xa0The most critical provision in the plan concerning climate is Article XXVIII, which contains a section entitled ‘Actively respond to climate change”, but various other provisions also touch on climate issues.\\xa0 Relevant provisions are summarised below:\\xa0Article III: Main Goals\\xa0Section 1 of Article 3 sets out China’s long-term goals until 2035. It includes an emphasis on “green modes of production” and notes that “carbon emissions will decline steadily after reaching a peak”. More detailed objectives are set out in Section 2, which reads: “Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5% and 18% respectively, total emissions of the main pollutants will continue to fall, and the rate of forest coverage will increase to 24.1%. The ecological environment will continue to improve, ecological safety barriers will be made more secure, and urban and rural living environments will be significantly improved.”\\xa0Article IX: Develop and expand strategic emerging industries\\xa0Article 9 emphasises the need to seize opportunities for ecosystem driven development and includes provisions on bioenergy.\\xa0\\xa0Article XI Build a modern infrastructure system\\xa0This article includes plans to develop low-carbon, clean energy, with a focus on wind, hydro and nuclear, referred to as a “modern energy system”. It includes the goal of increasing “the proportion of non-fossil energy in total energy consumption to about 20%.” The section also includes provisions for the development of coal power and oil and gas exploration, although plans to develop coal will be subject to controls and where possible coal will be replaced with electricity.\\xa0References are also made to improved flood control and prevention mechanisms and to improved rail transportation.\\xa0Article XXIX Comprehensively Improve Urban Quality\\xa0This article describes plans to create green, low-carbon cities and urban flood control systems.\\xa0Article XXXI on the implementation of major regional strategies Section 2 of this article states that China will adhere to ecological priority and sustainable development, and cooperate to promote environmental protection. Section 5 states that the country will seek to \"reasonably control the intensity of coal development, promote the integrated development and utilisation of energy resources, and strengthen the ecological restoration of mines.\"Article XXXII on the implementation of coordinated development strategies at the regional scale This article states under section 5 that the country will promote the comprehensive management of ecologically degraded areas and the protection and restoration of ecologically fragile areas and support the construction of the Bijie Pilot Area.Article XXXIII Actively expand the space for maritime economic development\\xa0This article contains provisions regarding protection of the marine environment, wetland conservation, and the maintenance of at least 25% of natural shoreline.Article XXXVII Improve the quality and stability of ecosystemsThis article contains references to eco-system repair and protection, and in particular goals to increase forest cover, engage in greening programmes, prevent soil erosion, and “increase the wetland protection rate to 55%”.Article XXVIII Continue to improve environmental quality\\xa0This article contains the most important climate provisions in the plan.\\xa0Section 4 of this article is titled “actively respond to climate change”. The section notes that China will formulate an action plan to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030. It includes plans to “implement a system that focuses on carbon intensity control with a secondary focus on total carbon emission control and support qualified localities, key industries, and key enterprises in taking the lead in reaching peak carbon emissions.” It also suggests plans to “increase controls on other greenhouse gases such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons” and “improve the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem” to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It also mentions plans to increase monitoring in vulnerable regions and implement adaptation measures and refers to China’s continued engagement with multi-lateral climate negotiations.\\xa0Section 5 of the article refers to plans to increase the potential for marketized trading in carbon emissions.\\xa0Subsequent sections refer to plans to “promote the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels such as coal, promote the green transformation of steel, petrochemical, building materials, and other industries, and accelerate “transfer from highways to railways” and “transfer from highways to waterways” for bulk cargo and medium- and long-distance cargo transportation”.Concrete measures outlined under this article also include plans to “implement major energy-saving and low-carbon technology industrialization demonstration projects and carry out major project demonstrations such as near-zero energy- consumption buildings, near-zero carbon emissions, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).”\\xa0Article XLI Promote high-quality “Belt and Road” development\\xa0This article sets out plans to continue China’s “Belt and Road” development and includes reference to international cooperation in the climate response and the creation of a Green Silk Road.',\n",

Section 5 states that the country will seek to \"reasonably control the intensity of coal development, promote the integrated development and utilisation of energy resources, and strengthen the ecological restoration of mines.\"Article XXXII on the implementation of coordinated development strategies at the regional scale This article states under section 5 that the country will promote the comprehensive management of ecologically degraded areas and the protection and restoration of ecologically fragile areas and support the construction of the Bijie Pilot Area.Article XXXIII Actively expand the space for maritime economic development\\xa0This article contains provisions regarding protection of the marine environment, wetland conservation, and the maintenance of at least 25% of natural shoreline.Article XXXVII Improve the quality and stability of ecosystemsThis article contains references to eco-system repair and protection, and in particular goals to increase forest cover, engage in greening programmes, prevent soil erosion, and “increase the wetland protection rate to 55%”.Article XXVIII Continue to improve environmental quality\\xa0This article contains the most important climate provisions in the plan.\\xa0Section 4 of this article is titled “actively respond to climate change”. The section notes that China will formulate an action plan to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030. It includes plans to “implement a system that focuses on carbon intensity control with a secondary focus on total carbon emission control and support qualified localities, key industries, and key enterprises in taking the lead in reaching peak carbon emissions.” It also suggests plans to “increase controls on other greenhouse gases such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons” and “improve the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem” to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It also mentions plans to increase monitoring in vulnerable regions and implement adaptation measures and refers to China’s continued engagement with multi-lateral climate negotiations.\\xa0Section 5 of the article refers to plans to increase the potential for marketized trading in carbon emissions.\\xa0Subsequent sections refer to plans to “promote the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels such as coal, promote the green transformation of steel, petrochemical, building materials, and other industries, and accelerate “transfer from highways to railways” and “transfer from highways to waterways” for bulk cargo and medium- and long-distance cargo transportation”.Concrete measures outlined under this article also include plans to “implement major energy-saving and low-carbon technology industrialization demonstration projects and carry out major project demonstrations such as near-zero energy- consumption buildings, near-zero carbon emissions, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).”\\xa0Article XLI Promote high-quality “Belt and Road” development\\xa0This article sets out plans to continue China’s “Belt and Road” development and includes reference to international cooperation in the climate response and the creation of a Green Silk Road.',\n",

That plan comes under the Physical Planning Act 2003.\\n\\nThe National Physical Development Plan (NPDP) stems from the Physical Planning Act of 2003. It is meant to provide a strategic, national spatial development framework that addresses current development issues, and provides a platform for feasible private and public sector development initiatives, reflecting local cultural values and aspirations over the next twenty years. The Sustainable Island Resource Management Zoning Plan (SIRMZP) of 2012 is itself designed to serve as a revised NPDP that meets the criteria of the Physical Planning Act.\\n\\nThe SIRMZP seeks more specific options to optimise the productive use of environmental resources while protecting critical ecosystems and promoting the local economic development, notably in the tourism, services, agriculture and industrial sectors. It does so by providing geographic and sectoral analysis to suggest low-carbon development scenarios forward, and climate change adaptation measures such as minimum ground floor elevation.',\n",

The ultimate goal envisioned is for Pakistan to be one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2047. The following pillars of the vision meet elements of the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs):\\n- People first: developing social and human capital and empowering women\\n- Growth: sustained, indigenous, and inclusive growth\\n- Governance: democratic governance - institutional reform and modernisation of the public sector\\n- Security: energy, water and food security\\n- Entrepreneurship: private sector and entrepreneurship-led growth\\n- Knowledge economy: developing a competitive knowledge economy through value addition\\n- Connectivity: modernising transport infrastructure and regional connectivity.\\n\\nWhile the overall direction of the document is development of the country, climate change is considered as one of the challenges the country would face that requires mitigation and adaptation. Pakistan's vulnerabilities are seen as an important challenge of its transition towards a high level of sustained growth. Following vulnerabilities and challenges are mentioned in the document:\\n- Water security: current water availability is less than 1,100 cubic meters per person, down from 5,000 cubic meters in 1951; Pakistan's water storage capacity is limited to 30 days\\n- Food security: Pakistan ranks 76th of the 107 countries on the Global Food Security Index\\n- Glacial melt: Indus basin (water reservoir) affected by the glaciers in the Hindukush-Karakoram and Himalayas\\n- Biodiversity threat caused by climate change: habitat destruction and alteration, biotechnology (such as basmati rice, turmeric and neem) and threats of genetically modified seeds and germplasm to indigenous species\\n- Energy security: alternative energy\\n- Institutions that favour the status quo\\n- Infrastructure bottleneck.\\n\\nThe Vision 2025 stands upon the target fulfilment of the MDGs and SDGs by 2030. The document also sets out 25 goals in accordance to the 7 pillars. The goals that are related to the purpose of this study are as follows:\\n- Double power generation to over 45,000MW, to provide uninterrupted and affordable electricity\\n- Increase access to electricity from 67% to 90% of the population\\n- Improve generation mix (15%) and reduce distribution losses (10%) to reduce average cost per unit by over 25%\\n- Increase the share of indigenous sources of power generation to over 50%\\n- Address demand management by increasing usage of energy efficient appliances and products to 80%\\n- Increase water storage capacity to 90 days\\n- Improve water use efficiency in agriculture by 20%\\n- Ensure access to clean drinking water for all citizens\\n- Reduce food insecure population from 60% to 30%.\",\n",

To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

       "           'action_description': \"The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals.

       "           'action_description': \"The Law is the pillar of Japanese energy conservation policy as well as one of the two key climate law. It was enacted in 1979 in the light of the oil shock with a purpose of promoting effective and rational use of energy. It covers the following sectors: energy management in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors; energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances. The subjects of the Law are factories and workplaces that consume more than 1,500kL of oil equivalent energy annually. Among factories, there are two categories: Factory I that uses more than 3,000kL equivalent; and Factory II that uses between 1,500-3,000kL equivalent. Currently, it covers approximately 90% of the operators in the industrial sector.\\n\\nEnergy defined under this Law covers energies derived from oil, natural gas, coals, heat (fossil-derived) and other sources of energy derived from the above. Electricity derived from renewable sources such as solar PV, wind and biomass are not subject for this Law. Designated businesses are required to produce reports (regular reporting for Factory II, both regular and mid-term reporting for Factory I) to the Energy Agency of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The purpose of this is to report amount of fuel, heat and electricity used in the subject period. Reduction target of 1% on average is set out under the law, with a fine up to JPY1m (USD8,495) according to the violation.\\n\\nThis Law also mandates an appointment of licensed energy managers for the designated businesses. Other measures include energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances, energy conservation labelling, energy regulation for housing and building and Positive Evaluation of Action to Reduce Peak Demand Electricity.\\n\\nThe Top Runner Programme was introduced in a 1990 amendment, which certifies manufacturers and other entities that satisfy 'Top Runner' criteria. Criteria for the energy-saving performance regarding their products within the target fiscal years (within 3 to 10 years) are set based on the performance of the products with the highest (according to latest level) energy consumption efficiency (top runner performance). The programme applies to machinery, equipment, and building materials, as well as LED lamps and three phase induction motors. The last amendment, in November 2014, added windows to the programme.\",\n",
