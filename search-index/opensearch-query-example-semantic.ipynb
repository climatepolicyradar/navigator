Concluding the assessments of all the analyses, it can be \\nstated that baseline scenarios for all the models used for analysis did not identify any serious \\nthreats, although models signaled the need for enacting a policy for reducing debt in the \\ncoming years. Nonetheless, shock tests conducted under the baseline scenario reveals that \\nsituation worsens but does not result in instability, and the stability of public debt is more \\nsensitive to national currency depreciation and lower GDP growth rates. The long term low \\nlevel of GDP growth rate is the main factor having a negative impact on fiscal stability. \\nConsequently, the first priority of macroeconomic stability is to ensure high rates of economic \\ngrowth, which, in its turn, will prevent the depreciation of national currency, since GDP growth \\nassumes larger the amount also with regard to the national currency, which can counteract the \\ndepreciation pressures. Another conclusion of the analyses is also important, according to \\nwhich the level of debt stabilizes more rapidly if the growth of tax revenues is faster than the \\ngrowth of GDP, considering the fact that Armenia has such a possibility, since the assessed \\npotential level of tax revenues is for from the level of actually collected taxes.

Like previous five-year plans, the 14th Five Year plan sets out the direction of travel for China’s climate action over the period 2021 - 2025. It also contains references to the long-term direction of travel until 2035. The plan was released and ratified by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. The plan reiterates the previously announced target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and sets a goal of seeing emissions peak in 2030.\\xa0The most critical provision in the plan concerning climate is Article XXVIII, which contains a section entitled ‘Actively respond to climate change”, but various other provisions also touch on climate issues.\\xa0 Relevant provisions are summarised below:\\xa0Article III: Main Goals\\xa0Section 1 of Article 3 sets out China’s long-term goals until 2035. It includes an emphasis on “green modes of production” and notes that “carbon emissions will decline steadily after reaching a peak”. More detailed objectives are set out in Section 2, which reads: “Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5% and 18% respectively, total emissions of the main pollutants will continue to fall, and the rate of forest coverage will increase to 24.1%. The ecological environment will continue to improve, ecological safety barriers will be made more secure, and urban and rural living environments will be significantly improved.”\\xa0Article IX: Develop and expand strategic emerging industries\\xa0Article 9 emphasises the need to seize opportunities for ecosystem driven development and includes provisions on bioenergy.\\xa0\\xa0Article XI Build a modern infrastructure system\\xa0This article includes plans to develop low-carbon, clean energy, with a focus on wind, hydro and nuclear, referred to as a “modern energy system”. It includes the goal of increasing “the proportion of non-fossil energy in total energy consumption to about 20%.” The section also includes provisions for the development of coal power and oil and gas exploration, although plans to develop coal will be subject to controls and where possible coal will be replaced with electricity.\\xa0References are also made to improved flood control and prevention mechanisms and to improved rail transportation.\\xa0Article XXIX Comprehensively Improve Urban Quality\\xa0This article describes plans to create green, low-carbon cities and urban flood control systems.\\xa0Article XXXI on the implementation of major regional strategies Section 2 of this article states that China will adhere to ecological priority and sustainable development, and cooperate to promote environmental protection. Section 5 states that the country will seek to \"reasonably control the intensity of coal development, promote the integrated development and utilisation of energy resources, and strengthen the ecological restoration of mines.\"Article XXXII on the implementation of coordinated development strategies at the regional scale This article states under section 5 that the country will promote the comprehensive management of ecologically degraded areas and the protection and restoration of ecologically fragile areas and support the construction of the Bijie Pilot Area.Article XXXIII Actively expand the space for maritime economic development\\xa0This article contains provisions regarding protection of the marine environment, wetland conservation, and the maintenance of at least 25% of natural shoreline.Article XXXVII Improve the quality and stability of ecosystemsThis article contains references to eco-system repair and protection, and in particular goals to increase forest cover, engage in greening programmes, prevent soil erosion, and “increase the wetland protection rate to 55%”.Article XXVIII Continue to improve environmental quality\\xa0This article contains the most important climate provisions in the plan.\\xa0Section 4 of this article is titled “actively respond to climate change”. The section notes that China will formulate an action plan to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030. It includes plans to “implement a system that focuses on carbon intensity control with a secondary focus on total carbon emission control and support qualified localities, key industries, and key enterprises in taking the lead in reaching peak carbon emissions.” It also suggests plans to “increase controls on other greenhouse gases such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons” and “improve the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem” to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It also mentions plans to increase monitoring in vulnerable regions and implement adaptation measures and refers to China’s continued engagement with multi-lateral climate negotiations.\\xa0Section 5 of the article refers to plans to increase the potential for marketized trading in carbon emissions.\\xa0Subsequent sections refer to plans to “promote the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels such as coal, promote the green transformation of steel, petrochemical, building materials, and other industries, and accelerate “transfer from highways to railways” and “transfer from highways to waterways” for bulk cargo and medium- and long-distance cargo transportation”.Concrete measures outlined under this article also include plans to “implement major energy-saving and low-carbon technology industrialization demonstration projects and carry out major project demonstrations such as near-zero energy- consumption buildings, near-zero carbon emissions, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).”\\xa0Article XLI Promote high-quality “Belt and Road” development\\xa0This article sets out plans to continue China’s “Belt and Road” development and includes reference to international cooperation in the climate response and the creation of a Green Silk Road.',\n",

The plan links together DRM, DRR, and climate change adaptation as part of what it envisions to be a holistic planning process, and explicitly recognizes climate change as a major factor in contributing to Kiribati's vulnerability to disasters. The principal function of the National Disaster Risk Management Plan is to define the phases of disaster risk management in Kiribati, which range from readiness to long-term recovery, as well as the roles and responsibilities of government agencies during each phase. It therefore defines general DRM responsibilities that apply to all government bodies, such as maintaining a log of disaster resources and conducting annual review of DRM arrangements, as well as specific responsibilities, such as requiring the Meteorological Office to monitor threats and advise the Office of Te Beretitenti accordingly.\",\n",

To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

It implies a small reduction in overall GHG emissions by 2020, and a 4% increase between 2020 and 2030. The document presents a sectoral strategy aiming to address the key challenges that the Polish power industry must faces until 2030, including growing demand for energy, inadequate fuel, energy generation and transmission infrastructure, significant dependence on external supplies of natural gas and almost full complete dependence on external supplies of crude oil, as well as commitments in the field of environmental protection, including climate protection. The new Energy Policy for Poland until 2050, which will reflect the decisions made on the EU 2030 climate policy, is under preparation.\\xa0\\xa0The document establishes a number of measures addressing energy demand, including national energy efficiency targets, energy efficiency performance certificates, minimum standards for power-consuming products, supporting investments in energy saving, and applying demand-side management techniques.\\xa0\\xa0It also establishes that energy supply should consist of a mix between cogeneration, renewables, grid modernisation, and nuclear. With this end, the EPP fixes measurable targets, for example: increase the percentage of renewable energy sources to 15% by 2020 and to 20% by 2030; boost the share of biofuels in the transportation fuels market to 10%; and building of at least one biogas agricultural plant in each commune by 2020.\\xa0\\xa0The EPP 2030 strategy document establishes the need to gradually increase the share of bio-components fuel in transportation fuels so as to meet planned objectives. As a result, the government established differentiated fuel taxes in a way that to promotes alternative fuels.PEP 2040 was officially released on September 8, 2020.

A key output from the OREDP is the identification of ways to ensure the optimal coordination of a wide range of government departments, agencies and state bodies that are critical enablers for offshore wind and ocean energy development. The Plan identifies the next steps that must be taken to support the sustainable realisation of the economic potential of offshore renewable energy resources.\\nTaking into account a number of energy, economic development and environmental issues, the Plan identifies ten policy and enabling actions, along with responsible bodies and completion timeframes, which are key to the development of the offshore renewable energy sector: (i) put in place a robust governance structure; (ii) increase exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration; (iii) introduce initial market support tariff for ocean energy; (iv) develop renewable electricity export markets; (v) develop the supply chain for the offshore renewable energy industry; (vi) communicate that Ireland is open for business; (vii) explore potential for international collaboration; (viii) introduce a new planning and consent architecture for development in the marine area; (ix) put in place a number of mitigation measures to protect the environment; and (x) ensure appropriate infrastructure development.\",\n",

Physical and mental health is explicitly mentioned as an argument for increasing walking and cycling rates.Under this plan, the government will build more (protected) cycle lanes, provide cycle training for everyone and bikes available on prescription. It will also create a long term cycling programme, consult to strengthen the Highway Code for safety purposes, support local authorities to crack down on traffic offenses, create low traffic neighbourhoods to improve air quality, focus on areas with poor average health and increase access to e-bikes.\\xa0A budget of two billion pounds has been allocated to this plan.
