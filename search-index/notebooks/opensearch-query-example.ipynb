However, it was later recommended that the original tax proposal be converted into a flat rate CO2 emissions tax, effective from 1 September 2010. The emissions tax has initially been applied to passenger cars, and extended to commercial vehicles once agreed CO2 standards for these vehicles are set. New passenger cars will be taxed based on their certified CO2 emissions at ZAR75 (USD6.77) per g/km for each g/km above 120 g/km. This emissions tax will be in addition to the current ad valorem luxury tax on new vehicles.',\n",

In the NEMMP 2020 document these are collectively referred to as xEVs. HEVs have both internal combustion and electric drives, which work in tandem leading to higher fuel efficiency. If the battery is used only when vehicle is started or stopped, for regenerative braking and limited electric motor assist, it is classified as mild hybrid. Whereas, full Hybrids have full electric launch assist and motor drive. PHEVs and Extended Range EVs (ER-EV) can run on batteries alone for a significant length and have ICE backup. BEVs run solely on batteries.',\n",

The Act requires the electric service provider to offset charges for electricity by the amount of electricity supplied by the customer from the customer generation system and requires the electric service provider to give the customer credit for electricity generated by the customer that exceeds the amount supplied by the electric service provider. It requires the customer to meet certain safety requirements with respect to the customer generating system. It prohibits the electric service provider from imposing additional charges or fees to customers participating in a net metering program.\\n\\nThrough net metering, Palau hopes to 1) encourage investment in renewable energy resources, 2) stimulate economic growth, 3) reduce demand for electricity when alternative energy is available, 4) enhance the continued diversification of the energy resources used in Palau, 5) reduce fossil fuel imports for electricity generation and increase energy independence, and 6) reduce carbon emissions.\\n\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>',\n",

It requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to airborne contaminants that are known to be hazardous to human health and/or welfare.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Congress passed the first Clean Air Act in 1963, creating a research and regulatory programme in the US Public Health Service. The Act authorised development of emission standards for stationary sources. In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established four new regulatory programmes:<br>&nbsp;- National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) - EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation)<br>&nbsp;- State Implementation Plans (SIPs)<br>&nbsp;- New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)<br>&nbsp;- National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection. The EPA\\'s 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established. The EPA also promulgated <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/clean-air-act-standards-and-guidelines-electric-utilities\">standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants</a> and from other stationary sources. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/nsps-ghg-emissions-new-modified-and-reconstructed-electric-utility\">New Source Performance Standards</a> from new, modified and reconstructed power plants were reinstated by the Biden administration in March 2021.

The law established four new regulatory programmes:<br>&nbsp;- National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) - EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation)<br>&nbsp;- State Implementation Plans (SIPs)<br>&nbsp;- New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)<br>&nbsp;- National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection. The EPA\\'s 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established. The EPA also promulgated <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/clean-air-act-standards-and-guidelines-electric-utilities\">standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants</a> and from other stationary sources. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/nsps-ghg-emissions-new-modified-and-reconstructed-electric-utility\">New Source Performance Standards</a> from new, modified and reconstructed power plants were reinstated by the Biden administration in March 2021. Public Law no 117-23 was signed by President Biden on June 30th, 2021, to cancel the rule submitted by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by the Trump administration on September 14th, 2020 to roll back restrictions on methane emissions in the oil and gas sector (85 Fed. Reg. 57018). Further to this, the EPA also <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/regulations-greenhouse-gas-emissions-aircraft\">standards for airplanes and airplane engines </a>in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/regulations-greenhouse-gas-emissions-passenger-cars-and\">passenger cars and trucks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/regulations-greenhouse-gas-emissions-commercial-trucks\">commercial trucks and buses</a>.&nbsp;',\n",

It considers changes to the regulatory framework, aims to assess jobs opportunity, and makes a range of financial commitments and targets, notably: 1) 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 (1GW by 2025), 2) provision of £240m for the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund out to 2024/25, 3) deliver hydrogen for heat trials, and 4) provide up to £120 million this year through the Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA) scheme towards 4,000 new zero emission buses, either hydrogen or battery electric, and infrastructure needed to support them. The strategy also calls for the development of metrics to monitor progress against outcomes and the commitments made, including incorporating data on hydrogen production into the Digest of UK Energy Statistics.\",\n",

       "           'document_description': \"Passed by the Riksdag in 2009, these laws originating in two government bills form the basis of Sweden's flagship climate policy, known as 'an Integrated Climate and Energy Policy.<br />\\n<br />\\nThe Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).<br />\\n<br />\\nThe Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.<br />\\n<br />\\nTargets outlined in this legislation include:<br />\\n- 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)<br />\\n- 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020<br />\\n- 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)<br />\\n- 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector<br />\\n- by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating<br />\\n- by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels<br />\\n- by 2050: zero net emissions of GHGs in Sweden.\",\n",

The revision consists in particular of extending the key climate protection instruments until the end of 2021. It helps prevent a regulatory vacuum until the complete revision of the CO2 law comes into force. The amendment to the ordinance also aims to implement a requirement of Parliament, namely a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.5% in 2021 compared to 1990. The Swiss people refused the law's full revision in June 2021.The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC. The document has been fully revised several times since the 2000 CO2 Act. The version in force and the 2020 Ordinance 641.711 have been amended to cover the period post 1.1.2020.\\xa0The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are:\\xa0- Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad\\xa0- CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met\\xa0- The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund.\\xa0- CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations).\\xa0- If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy\\xa0- Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects\\xa0- National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme\\xa0- Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading\\xa0- Prepare linking with EU ETS\\xa0- Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74%\\xa0- Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year\\xa0- Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned\\xa0- The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products\\xa0- Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars.\\xa0Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings). The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources. One third of the revenues (and no more than CHF300m USD313.4m) from the CO2 tax and cantonal funds are channelled into the Building programme.\\xa0Two updates of the programme were necessary as a result of its popularity.

The CO2 Act set an emission reduction objective of 10% for CO2 emissions for the period 2008-12 compared to 1990 levels (CO2 emissions represent around 80% of Switzerland's GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol). It contained a number of policy measures, which were further specified in action plans, programmes and policies and have been amended based on the changes to the CO2 Act since 2000. Those include:\\xa0- CO2 levy for thermal fuels\\xa0- Climate cent on transportation fuels\\xa0- Voluntary commitments\\xa0- Cross-cutting measures in areas suitable to climate policy integration\\xa0- Use of cap and trade market mechanisms and flexible mechanisms - Requires the Federal Council to propose further GHG emission reduction targets for period after 2012 leading up to 2020.\",\n",

The Swiss people refused the law's full revision in June 2021.The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC.

Key aspects are:\\xa0- Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad\\xa0- CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met\\xa0- The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund.\\xa0- CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations).\\xa0- If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy\\xa0- Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects\\xa0- National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme\\xa0- Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading\\xa0- Prepare linking with EU ETS\\xa0- Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74%\\xa0- Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year\\xa0- Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned\\xa0- The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products\\xa0- Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars.\\xa0Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings).

The revision consists in particular of extending the key climate protection instruments until the end of 2021. It helps prevent a regulatory vacuum until the complete revision of the CO2 law comes into force. The amendment to the ordinance also aims to implement a requirement of Parliament, namely a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.5% in 2021 compared to 1990. The Swiss people refused the law's full revision in June 2021.The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC. The document has been fully revised several times since the 2000 CO2 Act. The version in force and the 2020 Ordinance 641.711 have been amended to cover the period post 1.1.2020.\\xa0The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are:\\xa0- Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad\\xa0- CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met\\xa0- The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund.\\xa0- CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations).\\xa0- If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy\\xa0- Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects\\xa0- National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme\\xa0- Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading\\xa0- Prepare linking with EU ETS\\xa0- Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74%\\xa0- Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year\\xa0- Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned\\xa0- The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products\\xa0- Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars.\\xa0Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings). The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources.

The White Paper outlines a risk-based process to identify and prioritise adaptation strategies and interventions that have to be taken in the short and medium term, while reviewed every five years.<br />\\n<br />\\nConcerning mitigation, it includes proposals to set emission reduction outcomes for each significant sector and sub-sector of the economy based on an in-depth assessment of the mitigation potential, best available mitigation options and a full assessment of the costs and benefits using a 'carbon budgets' approach.

Adaptation efforts will require: early warning and forecasting for disaster risk reduction; medium-term (decade-scale) climate forecasting to identify potential resource challenges well in advance; and long-term climate projections that define the range of future climate conditions. Adaptation strategies are to be integrated into sectoral plans, including: The National Water Resource Strategy, as well as reconciliation strategies for particular catchments and water supply systems; The Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture; The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, as well as provincial biodiversity sector plans and local bioregional plans; The Department of Health Strategic Plan; The Comprehensive Plan for the Development of Sustainable Human Settlements; and the National Framework for Disaster Risk Management.<br />\\n<br />\\nIn order to monitor success of measures, South Africa will, within two years of the publication of the policy, design and publish a draft Climate Change Response Measurement and Evaluation System.\",\n",

The Strategy acknowledges that efforts to reduce emissions will have to significantly ramp up in order to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets (covering the periods 2023-2027 and 2028-2032).

It details the economic opportunities brought by the Paris Agreement for its low-carbon industries, notably thanks to its academic strength, expertise in high-value service and financial industries and stable regulatory framework. According to the document, the low carbon sector could grow by around 11% a year on the period 2015-2030, or four times faster than the overall economy, and \"could deliver between £60 billion and £170 billion of export sales of goods and services by 2030\".

The 2008 Act established support mechanisms that provided for 'equal preferential treatment for producers of electricity (green certificates); mandatory inclusion of utilities generating electricity from RES and biofuels into the national grid; establishing preferential prices for purchasing energy generated from RES (feed-in tariffs); and reducing the administrative burden on producers. The Act resulted in a rapid development of RES (wind and photovoltaic), which put upward pressure on electricity prices. As a result in June 2011 the Parliament adopted the Energy from Renewable Sources Act. The new legislation kept RES preferential treatment options but introduced a preference for energy from biomass and shifted the balance of power from RES producers to grid operators and allowed for a substantial reduction of the prices of energy from photovoltaic (PV)'.\",\n",

The <a href=\"https://ngd.essti.gov.et\">National Greening Action Program</a> derives from this goal.&nbsp;</li><li>Power: expanding electricity generation from renewable energy for domestic and regional markets&nbsp;</li><li>Transportation, industrial sectors and buildings: Leapfrogging to modern and energy efficient technologies.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;<br>The strategy targets climate change mitigation and adaptation. It sets a target to limit 2030 emissions to 150 Mt CO2e (level of 2010 emissions), approximately 250 Mt CO2e less than in the business as usual scenario. It also establishes a target to increase generating capacity by 25,000MW by 2030 - hydro 22,000MW, geothermal 1,000MW and wind 2,000MW. There are programmes to replace wood fuel for domestic use with less polluting fuels, such as biogas. There are plans to distribute 9m stoves by 2015 and 34m by 2030.&nbsp;<br><br>The initiative establishes a national financial mechanism called the \\'CRGE Facility\\' to mobilise, access, sequence and blend domestic and international, public and private sources of finance to support the institutional building and implementation of the strategy. The CRGE initially relies on existing institutions, notably the Environmental Protection Authority (which in 2013 was replaced by the Ministry of Environment and Forest), the Ethiopian Development Research Institute, six ministries, and several government agencies.

       "           'document_description': 'The Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE)\\'s vision is achieving middle-income status by 2025 in a climate-resilient green economy, outlining four pillars:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Agriculture: Improving crop and livestock production practices for higher food security and farmer income while reducing emissions&nbsp;</li><li>Deforestation: Reducing emissions by protecting and re-establishing forests for their economic and ecosystem services including as carbon stocks. The <a href=\"https://ngd.essti.gov.et\">National Greening Action Program</a> derives from this goal.&nbsp;</li><li>Power: expanding electricity generation from renewable energy for domestic and regional markets&nbsp;</li><li>Transportation, industrial sectors and buildings: Leapfrogging to modern and energy efficient technologies.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;<br>The strategy targets climate change mitigation and adaptation. It sets a target to limit 2030 emissions to 150 Mt CO2e (level of 2010 emissions), approximately 250 Mt CO2e less than in the business as usual scenario. It also establishes a target to increase generating capacity by 25,000MW by 2030 - hydro 22,000MW, geothermal 1,000MW and wind 2,000MW. There are programmes to replace wood fuel for domestic use with less polluting fuels, such as biogas. There are plans to distribute 9m stoves by 2015 and 34m by 2030.&nbsp;<br><br>The initiative establishes a national financial mechanism called the \\'CRGE Facility\\' to mobilise, access, sequence and blend domestic and international, public and private sources of finance to support the institutional building and implementation of the strategy. The CRGE initially relies on existing institutions, notably the Environmental Protection Authority (which in 2013 was replaced by the Ministry of Environment and Forest), the Ethiopian Development Research Institute, six ministries, and several government agencies. Subsequent phases will strengthen institutions to implement the strategy.',\n",

This involved a variety of activities, such as the installation of charging stations, but also the development and production of batteries, software, propulsion technology and vehicles. Since 2008, Dutch employment in electric transport has experienced continuous growth. In 2017, for example, 800 additional working years were created compared with 2016. Growth in electric transport up to 2020 is expected to be significant, but after 2020 PBL expects it to decline because policy after 2020 is as yet unclear (PBL, 2019a). As of 2025, sales of electric cars are expected to increase once more. As a result, the expected demand for labour will reach a similar level in 2030 as in 2017.',\n",

       "           'text': 'Electric roads are infrastructure for dynamic charging, in other words charging en route. Depending on the technology chosen, they can be used by trucks, buses and cars. A demonstration project is being carried out on the E16 outside Sandviken (heavy goods vehicles) and at Arlanda airport (heavy goods vehicles and cars). In April 2019, the Swedish Transport Administration decided to launch two more demonstration projects, which are currently being carried out in Lund (public transport) and on Gotland (heavy goods vehicles and public transport). The demonstration project on Gotland uses induction, so there is no need for a fixed connection with the vehicle, while the other projects use conduction, so the vehicle has to be physically connected to the electricity supply. The Swedish Transport Administration is currently preparing to build the first permanent electric road. The Government believes that electric roads will increase the efficiency of goods transport and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It therefore intends to develop a long-term plan to construct and expand electric roads. Major goods routes and links to ports should be prioritised. The need for complementary technologies to allow vehicles to run on electricity outside the electric road network, for example rapid charging points for heavy goods traffic, should be addressed in future work.',\n",

The diesel powered electricity generator in the existing trains that drive the motors connected to the wheels, remain idle most of the time, except when running at steady speed. When the train is electrified through the grid, there is no such wastage of fuel and when the train brakes or decelerates, the motors will transform to generators producing electricity which will be returned to the grid for later use. In electrification of the railway system, the existing railway tracks could be used (with zero voltage) with electricity provided through overhead lines (25 kilovolt) drawn above the railway lines and loops (IESL, 2008).',\n",

That being said, the average fuel consumption and emissions per vehicle is projected to decrease slowly at least until 2030, as manufacturers respond to recent EU Regulations which set emission reduction targets on the fleet average of vehicle manufacturers. Meeting such targets is expected require manufacturers to include an increasing share of electric cars in their fleet, a trend expected to be reflected in the stock of newly imported vehicles in Malta. The effect of this development may be somewhat delayed as a signficant portion of newly licensed vehicles tend to be imported second-hand vehicles (56% in 2017). An increasing number of electric vehicles is bound to impinge on the average consumption of electricity although the impact on peaks may be mitigated through effective demand management. In this context, an advantageous night-time electricity tariff, applicable to EV charging, is being introduced as from 2020.',\n",

The proposed Energy Efficiency Act includes the following provisions:<br>1) Mandate commercial building planning regulations(e.g. mandatory renewable sources contribution to energy consumption for new buildings);<br>2) Require the use of energy efficiency standards and building codes for ventilation, cooling, water- and process-heating, lighting and in institutional, commercial and industrial buildings;<br>3) Require all government buildings of a certain size to have periodic energy audits and compliance audits;<br>4) Mandate the compilation and publication of sectoral benchmarking data (e.g., kWh per hotel room-night for the hotels sector);<br>5) Require commercial banks to provide financial incentives for investments in energy efficiency to businesses and homeowners;<br>6) Mandate specified fuel efficiencies for imported vehicles;<br>7) Require training in 'eco-driving' practices for public and private sector organisations;<br>8) Develop, monitor, publish and update indicators of national energy consumption and efficiency.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;As of August 2014, the government had not passed legislation to make the measures outlined in the GNEP legally binding, but it is currently drafting a concession law for the exploration and exploitation of geothermal resources.\",\n",

This is equivalent to 22-23% of primary energy consumption, while fossil fuel use will fall from 86% to 76%. Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).6) Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures.\\xa0To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:1) Fostering Energy Efficiency2) Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices3) Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\\\\20-20-20\\\\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive4) Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production5) Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level6) Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection7) Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient8) Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system\\xa0The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:1) The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical2) The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure3) A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport4) The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario',\n",

Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).6) Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures.\\xa0To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:1) Fostering Energy Efficiency2) Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices3) Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\\\\20-20-20\\\\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive4) Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production5) Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level6) Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection7) Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient8) Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system\\xa0The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:1) The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical2) The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure3) A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport4) The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario',\n",

The costs for the fossil fuels used for propulsion purposes in passenger cars will increase slightly over time because of increases in energy efficiency. Technology costs will drop for electric and hybrid drives, primarily as a result of battery development. The costs for electric and hybrid vehicles will remain higher than conventional vehicles until 2030; in the longer term, investment costs for battery electric drive systems could however be much lower than for drive systems based on liquid or gaseous fuels.',\n",
