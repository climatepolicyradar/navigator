Based on the assessment of current formulation stage of the Priority Actions, some order to develop full GCF funding proposals, further formulation efforts will be necessary. Yet, formulation s preparedness for the effective implementation of adaptation projects and programs. When benefitting from this specialized support, countries are expected to be better able to assess their climate vulnerabilities and devise plans that help them be precise in targeting interventions. The new preparedness funding can help national institutions to bring the Priority Actions in the NAP to the next stage and get funding proposals ready to access the GCF adaptation window. The new GCF support underscores the important role that the NAPs planning process plays -resilient development. The application procedure to the NAP formulation specific preparedness support is the same as for the GCF readiness window and requires endorsement from the NDA (see section 4.2.3 for details).',\n",

The accompanying 10 Year National Water Resources Plan identifies water and sanitation projects costing approximately $A15M. The EU, under EDF10, has already made a commitment to fund approximately  6.7M of outer island water supply and sanitation projects. The policy and plan can be used in proposals to donors and funding agencies to highlight the priorities of Kiribati in water resources. Briefs for a number of projects for which donor funding could be sought are given in the Background to the National Water Resources Policy and Implementation Plan.',\n",

It is important to mention that blending SREP resources with other co-financing has the potential to make investment capital in infrastructure available (which may otherwise not be the case) or to facilitate the speed of adoption and scaling-up of -financing, and further debt arranging through other DFIs, will occur under the leadership and responsibility of IFC/AfDB Private Sector Department. The low cost financing would be instrumental in strengthening the commercial viability of the project. However, it is worth mentioning that a careful balance will be required to stimulate the market without creating long-term dependence on public subsidies. The MDB in charge of implementing the SREP resources, apart from its co-financing share, will seek to provide the minimum concessionality needed to catalyze this particular investment. In accordance with this principle, the SREP instrument will be chosen on a case-by-case basis to address the specific barriers identified in the project and risks associated with the technology, market, project implementation, and the financial structure. The amount and terms of SREP funding offered to an individual client will be determined between the MDB and the client on the basis of efficient and proper due diligence and in the effective use of SREP and MDB resources',\n",

To address these concerns, the Policy promotes the implementation of activities relating to: education and increased awareness; gender issues; promoting and diffusing research; monitoring and transferring knowledge; and institutional capacity building.\\nThe policy calls for the adoption and implementation of a Transport Policy with emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from this sector, especially through the promotion of the use of less carbon intensive fuels. It also stresses the importance of the implementation of the 2007 Renewable Energy Policy and other measures that promote the use and the production of renewables.\\nThe adoption of climate change strategies that address the impact of climate change and promote sustainable activities in the sectors of agriculture and livestock, fishery production, water management, forestry, wetland, biodiversity and ecosystem services and tourism are identified are important needs to develop Uganda's approach to adaption to climate change.\\nMoreover, the Policy also seeks to implement the basic institutional structure required to finance this awareness raising campaign and to develop a performance measurement framework for each ministry and agency involved. The policy also strengthens the Climate Change Unit, upgrading it to a National Climate Change Commission with a more advanced legal and institutional framework that can co-ordinate climate change policy across sectors and regions.

In 1994, with funding and s uppo r t f ro m th e Gl o b a l Environment Facility (GEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Uganda compiled a national inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sinks, which was updated in 1995 under the US Country Studies Program. With continuing GEF support, the country developed and submitted its Initial National Communication (INC) to UNFCCC in 2002. The INC included a national GHG inventory system, an assessment of the countrystatus of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and recommendations for adapting to and mitigating climate change. Uganda is now preparing the Second National Communication. In 2007, in conformity with UNFCCC and under a grant from GEF through UNEP, Uganda developed and submitted its National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) to UNFCCC. The NAPA includes a list of nine priority projects, many of which are yet to be rolled out and implemented. The priorities highlighted in the NAPA have been taken into account in developing this policy.',\n",

To help government to align resources with policy priorities, a partial form of programme budgeting was introduced in the early 2000s, with the adoption of Priority Action Programmes. These were replaced in 2007 by programmes. There are 33 budget entities, of which 8 currently have programmes identified (MLVT, MLMUC, MOJMWA, MRD, MAFF, MEYS, and MOH). These innovations have helped ministries to pursue policy priorities and encourage the integration of recurrent and capital budgets.

RA 10121 provides a comprehensive, all-hazard, multi-sectoral, inter-agency, and community-based approach to disaster risk management through the formulation of the National Disaster Risk Management Framework.\\xa0\\xa0A National Disaster Risk Management Plan (NDRMP) is being formulated, developed, and implemented as the master plan that will provide the strategies, organisation, tasks of concerned agencies and local government units, and other guidelines in dealing with disasters or emergencies. Through this plan, a coherent, integrated, efficient, and responsive disaster risk management at all levels will hopefully be achieved.\\xa0\\xa0The law also promotes the development of capacities in disaster management at the individual, organisational, and institutional levels. A very important feature of this law is its call for the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in physical and land-use planning, budget, infrastructure, education, health, environment, housing, and other sectors.\\xa0\\xa0RA 10121 also recognises local risk patterns and trends and decentralisation of resources and responsibilities and thus encourages the participation of NGOs, private sectors, community-based organisations, and community members in disaster management. It inhibits the full participation of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and communities in governance. The approach tends to be 'response-oriented' or 'reactive.' This is evidenced by the widespread emphasis on post-disaster relief and short-term preparedness, such as forecasting and evacuation, rather than on mitigation and post- disaster support for economic recovery.\\xa0\\xa0Moreover, the Act mandates the establishment of a Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) in every province, city and municipality, and a Barangay Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Committee (BDRRMC) in every barangay.\\xa0\\xa0The Strategic National Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction for 2009-2019 aims to enhance the capacities of Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils.\\xa0\\xa0Finally, RA10121 provides for the calamity fund to be used in support of disaster risk reduction or mitigation, prevention, and preparedness activities for the potential occurrence of disasters and not just for response, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.\",\n",

It also names institutions that shall pursue the analytical and managerial tasks needed to finance the transition, amend laws and take other measures to reach the overall emissions and efficiency targets.\\xa0 The Plan gives directions to reducing electricity consumption via setting up an advisory team to the Finance Minister and the Accountant General to consult on the objective of granting NIS 500 million over ten years for investment loans in energy efficiency and greenhouse gases emissions reductions.

Earthquake disasters are not as frequent as the typhoons and flooding that take place in the Philippines. Nevertheless, the impact generated on affected communities is usually massive and devastating. Earthquake-induced disasters were few in numbers and in terms of casualties. Within the 10-year period five (5) destructive earthquakes were recorded and human casualty included 15 deaths and 119 persons injured. Damage to the economy was estimated to reach P0.207-B.  The 1990 Luzon Earthquake, the Moro Gulf Tsunami and the collapse of the Ruby Tower were the most notably devastating earthquake disasters in the Philippines.The Philippines is also prone to volcanic eruptions being situated along the the Pacific Ring of Fire where two major tectonic plates (Philippine Sea and Eurasian) meet.  This explains the occurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis and the existence of around 300 volcanoes of which 22 are active.',\n",

Work has been conducted on assessing the drivers of forest cover change through partnership between CCDA and PNGFA as well as UNDP and FAO and developing the for key components of REDD+ namely the National REDD+ Strategy (NRS), the Safeguards Information System (SIS), the National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) and the Forest Reference Level (FRL) (see Figure 8 and Annex 1 for further information). This work is now showing significant progress with the NFMS becoming operational and publically available in 2016 (see www. nfms-png.org), the FRL submitted to the UNFCCC for technical assessment in January 2017 and a roadmap developed for the establishment of a SIS.

The Plan addresses eight action areas identified by the NCCRS, in addition to including a new subcomponent focusing on co-ordination. It defines clear measures on adaptation and mitigation to climate change across a wide range of issues, bringing an important contribution to the development of Kenya's legal and political framework in this realm. The 2013-2017 Climate Change Action Plan fits in the Kenya 2030 Vision, a long-term development plan adopted by the government in 2008. Implemented in successive five year plans, the 2030 vision is comprises three pillars (economic, social, and political). The 2013-2017 Climate Change Action Plan was replaced in May 2018 by the National Climate Change Action Plan 2018-2022.\",\n",

Hydropower is currently contributing to the national grid, and the document identifies its potential contribution to rural power needs. It also promises that the underutilized solar power will be developed, both for solar electricity and solar heat. Policy measures specific to renewable energy includes: to adopt a long-term government-driven, renewable energy technologies (RETs) programme, which encourages IPPS and public-private partnerships to harness sustainable RETs; to institute innovative funding mechanisms and finance opportunities such as Clean Development Mechanisms, feed-in-tariffs and micro-credit institutions for RETs; to institute RETs-sustainable capacity building programmes; to raise awareness about the benefits and opportunities of renewable energy; to encourage local production and the commercialisation of technologies; to strengthen the institutional framework for research and development and the promotion of renewable energy technologies; to promote investment into standalone solar energy systems to cater four rural communities; to promote efficient use of biomass for cooking; to encourage the use of waste biomass for energy purposes; and to develop incentives for investment in renewable energy (such as subsidies and tax concessions).\",\n",

However, as noted earlier the VISIP process has been designed to generate a frequently refreshed pipeline of projects. It follows that new projects would be added to the shortlist in line infrastructure planning and consequent updates to the VISIP. Funding would also be assed in the VISIP updates, and in this context review available from continued external funding support, private sector contributions to infrastructure, and possibly a gradual increase in contributions from GoV internal resources.',\n",

However, the profile of expenditure of the green initiatives typically has a bulge at the beginning due mainly to upfront capital investment. Upfront investments for green economy initiatives are usually higher due to the higher investment required in modern and efficient technology, compared to the one of the traditional path, as well as the investment required to set up the different scale-up programmes. On the other hand, the medium- to long-term running costs are typically lower due to the combined effects of fuel savings and efficient use of other resources.

The EPACC also identifies institutions responsible for mitigating these risks. Specific adaptation objectives include:Reducing impacts of droughts by cloud seeding to induce rainEstablishing building and construction codes that ensure structures withstand extreme weather eventsStoring food and feed in good years for use in bad yearsEnsuring transportation access to disaster prone areasDeveloping insurance schemes for weather damage compensationOrganising local communities for quick response to extreme weather eventsPreparing to cater for refugees driven out of their homes by climate changeMapping and delineating areas likely to suffer from climate change and extreme weather eventsDeveloping an accessible information network on climate changeDeveloping an early warning system to alert people of impending extreme weather events',\n",

Upfront investments for green economy initiatives are usually higher due to the higher investment required in modern and efficient technology, compared to the one of the traditional path, as well as the investment required to set up the different scale-up programmes. On the other hand, the medium- to long-term running costs are typically lower due to the combined effects of fuel savings and efficient use of other resources.

As explained earlier, several EE measures are not deemed as financially viable which leads to a significant funding gap. A similar situation exists for small scale RES such as Solar Water Heaters (SWH) and Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWH). The uptake of the former has dwindled over the past years, and the latter technology has yet to take off. Furthermore, thousands of solar water heaters are expected to reach their end of life in the next 5 years. In order to meet the renewable energy contribution as well energy efficiency targets under article 7, it is estimate that around 800 households would need to be supported to purchase either a SWH or a HPWP each year until 2030. Government support would need to be leveraged by EU funding if this figure is to be achieved. The budget for this measure is estimated at 14 million Euros. Malta is also banking on EU Funds to support Energy Efficiency actions by Voluntary organisations, industry and services sectors. The total budget for the aforementioned is set at 5 million euros and 17.5 million euros respectively.',\n",

Even though the form of a national adaptation strategic and implementing entity has not yet been elaborated in the UNFCCC, an entity such as a National Adaptation Facility (NAF) will be necessary in future. A National Adaptation Facility or Authority should therefore be established to enable mobilisation and consolidation of resources from multiple sources. In developing such a capacity, there are many options that must be based on the unique structures of national government and civil society. The term “authority” is open in that where a cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder capacity is required it might involve a single ‘authority’ or ‘agency’ or a multi-party structure with operational capacity that might be termed ‘facility,’ ‘hub’ or ‘partnership.’ It will also require consultative and governing structures (i.e. advisory committee, council, board, governing body) and funding will be vital to its success.
