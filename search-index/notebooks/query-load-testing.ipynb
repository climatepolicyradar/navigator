These cars will also be exempt from vehicle tax.

In 1980 the income tax rates on companies were 60 percent compared to the 27.5% in the 2009-10 FY. The concessions are made to attract investment from both domestic and foreign sources and achieve rapid growth in the manufacturing sector. Tax policy during the FY11-15 will emphasize an expansion of the tax base and rationalization of the tax system. Although the fundamental structure of the tax system is sound, the extensive use of exemptions, incentives and other special provisions have resulted in a tax system that is prone to evasion. The resulting complex structure of trade taxes also gives rise to significant distortion in economic activity and undermines the equity of the tax system. The Internal Resources Division and the National Board of Revenue is reviewing the tax incentives and exemptions with the aim of broadening the tax base and ensuring greater tax equity.',\n",

The Framework Act requires the government to establish and implement a national strategy, action plans, and a detailed 5-year plan for a planning period of 20 years, which will deal with various aspects of climate change mitigation and adaptation.\\xa0The framework defines the main principles of a green economy, including green growth via environmental technologies and industries, and the balance between environment and economy. The Committee on Green Growth is established to deliberate on the State's major policies and plans related to low carbon green growth. Since 2013 this Committee has operated under the Prime Minister's Office. The Framework declares that the government will foster new green industries with high growth potential, by formulating means to transform traditional industries into green ones, setting targets and adapting infrastructure to an environmentally friendly structure; green investment companies shall be established and may be supported by the government; and the Framework also calls for facilitation of research, development and commercialisation of green technology. The Framework prescribes mandatory annual GHG emission reporting to the government, and the establishment of an Integrated Information Management System for GHGs.\\xa0The Framework instructs the government to prepare and enforce a basic plan for energy every 5 years for a planning period of 20 years. The plan should include aspects of energy security and independence, as well as targets for energy supply from renewable sources and energy demand management via saving and efficiency. The Framework calls for the preparation of REDD/Land Use policies and transportation policies - including the establishment of standards for emissions from different classes of automobiles. It prescribes an assessment of impacts of climate change and the implementation of measures for adaptation. The Enforcement Decree is designed to provide for matters delegated by the Act and matters necessary for enforcement thereof including establishment of central and local action plans, operation of the Presidential Committee on Green Growth, establishment of and support for green industries investment companies and control of quantity of GHGs emitted and the quantity of energy consumed in each area including transportation and architecture, etc.\\xa0The Decree sets a target of a reduction in total national GHG emissions in 2020 by 30% from the business-as-usual projection for 2020. Regarding transportation policies, the Decree addresses the management of the standards for corporate-average energy consumption efficiency of automobiles and compatible corporate-average allowable exhaust emissions of GHGs from automobiles. The Decree deals with the establishment of green industries investment companies. It also provides that the Minister of Environment shall establish and implement, every 5 years, measures for adaptation to climate change based on consultation with the heads of the central administrative agencies concerned.

The revision consists in particular of extending the key climate protection instruments until the end of 2021. It helps prevent a regulatory vacuum until the complete revision of the CO2 law comes into force. The amendment to the ordinance also aims to implement a requirement of Parliament, namely a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.5% in 2021 compared to 1990. The Swiss people refused the law's full revision in June 2021.The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC.

The version in force and the 2020 Ordinance 641.711 have been amended to cover the period post 1.1.2020.\\xa0The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are:\\xa0- Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad\\xa0- CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met\\xa0- The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund.\\xa0- CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations).\\xa0- If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy\\xa0- Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects\\xa0- National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme\\xa0- Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading\\xa0- Prepare linking with EU ETS\\xa0- Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74%\\xa0- Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year\\xa0- Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned\\xa0- The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products\\xa0- Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars.\\xa0Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings).

The purpose of this prohibition is to prevent shareholders from dividing a single large business into multiple small businesses so as to artificially obtain undue tax benefits for each of these divided parts. Unfortunately, this exclusion has the unintended effect of denying relief for small business owners who place their businesses in purchased shelf companies. To remedy this situation, the exclusion against multiple company ownership should not apply in respect of companies that have never been more than a shell.\\n* Taxpayers engaged in domestic short-term insurance operations can only deduct their reserves if these reserves are regulated by the Financial Services Board as a condition for engaging in the short-term insurance business. The law needs to be clarified to ensure that reserves relating to offshore short-term insurance operations are eligible for potential deductions only if subject to substantially similar regulation and evaluation by SARS.\\n* Leasing losses from financial (i.e. non-operating) leases or leasing losses of a bank or financier can only be used against leasing income. A technical anomaly has arisen that prevents these leasing losses from being used against corresponding recoupments from the disposal of assets giving rise to these leasing losses. No reason exists for preventing the application of these losses in these circumstances, and this anomaly will accordingly be removed.\\n* CFCs generate net income that is imputed to their South African resident shareholders (thereby being subject to South African tax) to the extent these CFCs have tainted income (e.g. passive income and income likely to be diverted offshore for tax avoidance reasons). Because the objective nature of the tainted CFC income characterisation sometimes creates tax where no tax avoidance exists, Section 9D(10) was added to provide relief if SARS provides a ruling that the transaction does not represent an erosion of\\n\\n* Various pressures exist to liquidate entities with inactive real estate (e.g. vacant land and residential property). To alleviate these pressures, it is proposed that rollover relief be provided to facilitate these liquidations for a transitional period.\\n* Securities lending has features of both loans and disposals. The tax law generally treats these loans as disposals, with limited relief for 12 months for certain arrangements. It has now been discovered that certain securities lending arrangements seek to be treated as loans for certain purposes and as a loss of ownership for others, generating artificial losses. While this treatment is suspect under current law, it may be necessary to clarify the law so that all forms of securities lending fall under either loan or disposal treatment (not a mix of both).\\n* A revised Companies Act was introduced in 2008 that will become effective as of 1 January 2010. The impact of this new legislation on income tax is under review. Corresponding tax changes will generally be initiated in 2010 once the full ramifications of the revised act are fully accounted for, with urgent matters initiated in 2009.\\n* Two years ago, government enacted an income tax incentive to encourage domestic oil and gas exploration and production. To qualify for this relief, it was intended that companies must be engaged solely in oil exploration and production, with other sources of income coming solely from passive sources. On review, it has been determined that the legislation was too restrictive because typical oil and gas operations entail incidental business activities. It is accordingly proposed that the oil and gas incentive regime be liberalised in this respect. However, the law also needs to be clarified to ensure that the incentive does not permit the deduction of oil and gas exploration expenditure outside the Republic.\\n* Telephone lines and cables are currently eligible for a 5 per cent depreciation write-off over 20 years. The telecommunications industry is now seeking to lay underwater cables for voice and data communications off the African coast. It is accordingly proposed that these underwater cables be given the same 5 per cent write off as land-based telephone lines and cables. An issue under examination is the extent to which this write-off should be available for different forms of utilisation (e.g. joint ownership versus an indefeasible right of use).\\n* The telecommunications industry operates under a variety of licenses (e.g. 2G and 3G, frequency and internet provider). The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa is planning to require consolidation of these related licenses into a single telecommunications license per company to simplify administration. It is proposed that these regulatory consolidations be legislatively treated as a tax-free rollover event (to the extent the consolidation would otherwise give rise to capital gains taxation).\\n* As a theoretical matter, improvements should be treated on par with underlying initial investments for purposes of tax depreciation. If an initial â\\x80\\x9cnew and unusedâ\\x80\\x9d investment can be depreciated over 20 years, â\\x80\\x9cnew and unusedâ\\x80\\x9d improvements for a similar investment should similarly be depreciable over 20 years (even if the underlying investment is not â\\x80\\x9cnew and unusedâ\\x80\\x9d). While this principle exists in certain circumstances, the law needs to be clarified to ensure that this principle uniformly applies for all depreciable items.',\n",

Operational uncertainty now exists as to whether settlements may be concluded prior to assessments. It is therefore proposed that section 88A be clarified to ensure that settlement procedures are limited to post-assessment.\\n* The Income Tax and VAT Acts do not require SARS to pay interest on the overpayment of tax when a taxpayer is required to pay a disputed amount while the amount is subject to objection â\\x80\\x93 with the objection subsequently being allowed. This non-payment of interest is arguably contrary to one of the core principles on which the constitutionality of the â\\x80\\x9cpay now argue laterâ\\x80\\x9d principle is based. In order to address these concerns, it is proposed that the Income Tax and VAT Acts be amended to: (i) clarify that payment is not suspended due to objection, (ii) formalise the circumstances where payment will be required despite objection, and (iii) provide for interest where a payment made pending consideration of an objection is refunded.\\n* If employers fail to withhold and pay over to SARS employeesâ\\x80\\x99 tax, SARS can enforce payment of this tax amount as a â\\x80\\x9cpenaltyâ\\x80\\x9d.

       "            'text': 'Miscellaneous estate duty amendments\\n* Under current law, both spouses are each entitled to an estate duty deduction of R3.5 million. In widely accepted estate planning, each spouse seeks to use the R3.5 million deduction by removing assets worth R3.5 million from the estate while keeping practical control of the assets for the benefit of the spouse via a trust mechanism. It is proposed that spouses be given flexibility in using their combined estate duty deductions without the artifice of the (often costly and complex) trust mechanism. Under this proposal, the surviving spouseâ\\x80\\x99s (or spousesâ\\x80\\x99) estate will benefit from the unused deduction of the deceased spouse automatically.\\n* Estates with a value exceeding the R3.5 million deduction threshold are issued their initial estate duty assessments (or deemed assessments) when the assets of the estate are distributable. SARS can also raise additional assessments within the following five years (and in some cases beyond). Enforcement after closure of the estate, however, is problematic as a practical matter because the executor no longer has control over the assets. It is therefore proposed that the current five-year rule for additional assessment and recovery be reconsidered so as to reach finality upon the closure of the estate (to the extent possible) while protecting the fiscus against fraud, misrepresentation and non-disclosure.\\n* A commonly known one-year usufructuary scheme exists in the market that allegedly undermines the estate duty. This scheme involves the estate duty-free transfer of a life-time usufructuary interest to a spouse, with the children receiving the bare dominium. On the death of the spouse, the usufructuary interest is transferred with a one-year interest going to a person, after which the remaining rights transfer to the intended heirs. The scheme essentially relies on the misapplication of the 12 per cent per annum valuation presumption in the context of a one-year interest. This scheme will accordingly be closed.',\n",

An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.\\xa0\\xa0The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.\\xa0\\xa0The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.\\xa0\\xa0The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.\\xa0\\xa0During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.\\xa0\\xa0Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.\\xa0\\xa0The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.\\xa0\\xa0Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme.

This change applies retroactively from 1 January 2015 (when the previous guarantee for PTC originally expired). The Act also includes a phase-out provision, under which the volume of PTC depends on beginning of the construction of the wind facilities: 20% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2017, 40% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2018, and 60% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2019.\\nThe Act allows wind facilities brought into service before 1 January 2020 to choose the 'investment tax credit' (ITC) program, based upon a percentage of each energy property brought into service during any taxable year, instead of the PTC program.

This change applies retroactively from 1 January 2015 (when the previous guarantee for PTC originally expired). The Act also includes a phase-out provision, under which the volume of PTC depends on beginning of the construction of the wind facilities: 20% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2017, 40% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2018, and 60% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2019.\\nThe Act allows wind facilities brought into service before 1 January 2020 to choose the 'investment tax credit' (ITC) program, based upon a percentage of each energy property brought into service during any taxable year, instead of the PTC program. The ITC program applies similar percentage-based phase-out support as the PTC program.\\nThe Act extends the ITC program for solar energy until 2021, with a percentage-based phase-out provision.

It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000. The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities. Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios. The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes. The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner. The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law. The law was amended in 2014 to establish a tax on fossil fuels, and in 2016 at article 94 to frame a carbon market. Attached regulation sets the framework for the accounting of carbon emissions. The law was further amended in 2018 by Decree 13/07/2018, notably to initiate a national market of greenhouse gases emissions and to precise the contribution of Mexico within the scope of the Paris Agreement.\",\n",
       "            'action_description': \"The approval of the GLCC gives certainty and continuity to climate policy in Mexico and sets the country on a path to a low carbon economy. It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000. The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress.

To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

       "            'action_description': \"The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

       "            'action_description': \"The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, including by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019. The Zero Carbon Amendment Act sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Other notable amendments: On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed to amend the 2002 Act. This amendment reforms the existing trading scheme created by the 2008 Amendment to the Act. The Amendment aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration. It also allows for the phase down of industrial allocation from 2021 with greater reductions from 2030.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.\\xa0 The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.\",\n",

Peak balancing only applies if the company operates an energy management system or environmental management system (for SMEs: implementation of an alternative system) and the manufacturing sector as a whole achieves the annual energy intensity reduction target.

In addition to fleet adjustment, additional measures are required in order to significantly increase the percentage of vehicles with alternative drive systems in sales of new vehicles and to significantly reduce the carbon emissions of passenger car traffic. These measures are intended to significantly reduce the extra costs associated with electric cars compared to cars powered only by combustion engines, and to help make the filling and charging ctive. At the same time, they will stimulate the supply and demand for alternative drive systems. With the law on tax incentives to promote e-mobility, the company car regulation for the use of a battery-powered electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid vehicle has been extended until 2030, among other measures. In addition, up to a price of EUR 40 000 the private use of purely electric vehicles will not, as has hitherto been the case, be valued on half the assessment basis, but on a quarter of the assessment basis. The tax exemption under §3d of the law on motor vehicle tax will also be extended until 31 December 2025. The 10-year tax exemption period will be limited to 31 December 2030 at the latest. In a further step, for passenger cars with electric, hybrid and hydrogen / fuel cell drive systems the purchase premium paid by the Federal Government and manufacturers has been extended until 2025 at the latest, with retroactive effect from 5 November 2019 inclusive, and increased for cars under EUR 40 000. The Federal Government will be gearing motor vehicle taxes more strongly towards carbon emission levels and will also be putting forward a law on the reform of the motor vehicle tax for passenger cars, in the expectation that these taxation aspects will exert a much stronger steering effect towards low-emission and zero-emission systems for new car purchases. For new registrations from 1 January 2021, the assessment basis for the tax will depend primarily on the CO2 test value per km and will be increased in stages above 95 g CO2 / km.',\n",

Exemption applies if:\\n\\n\\n \"the electricity was delivered on a grid that has a capacity that is less than 100 MW and that is not, directly or indirectly, connected to a grid that has a capacity of 100 MW or more; or\\n the end user of the electricity generated the electricity and either of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the point at which the electricity is generated is less than 1 km from the point at which the electricity is used; (ii) the electricity is transmitted or distributed between the point of generation and the point of use and the line on which the electricity is transmitted or distributed is used solely for the transmission or distribution of electricity between those 2 points\" (Art 31).\\n\\nWhere a liable entity does not have enough certificates to surrender in a year, it will have to pay renewable energy shortfall charge. There are 2 types of renewable energy shortfall charge:\\n\\n\\n\"large?scale generation shortfall charge, which is calculated by reference to a liable entity\\'s relevant acquisitions of electricity, its exemptions, the number of large?scale generation certificates it surrenders and the renewable energy power percentage; and\\nsmall?scale technology shortfall charge, which is calculated by reference to a liable entity\\'s relevant acquisitions of electricity, its exemptions, the number of small?scale technology certificates it surrenders and the small?scale technology percentage\" (Art 34A).',\n",

The decision exposes the numerous emissions reductions and energy efficiency targets laid out in a process that originated in Government decision n. 542 of September 2015 and how those targets shall be attained. It also names institutions that shall pursue the analytical and managerial tasks needed to finance the transition, amend laws and take other measures to reach the overall emissions and efficiency targets.\\xa0 The Plan gives directions to reducing electricity consumption via setting up an advisory team to the Finance Minister and the Accountant General to consult on the objective of granting NIS 500 million over ten years for investment loans in energy efficiency and greenhouse gases emissions reductions. The grants program in energy efficiency will be operated by the Investment Centre and the National Authority for Technology and Innovation. The decision stipulates that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis over the economic performance of emissions reduction per unit of electricity saved. The Ministry of Finance alone shall allocate a budget of NIS 300 million.\\xa0 The decision tasks the Ministry of Energy to: 1) provide a multi-year plan for energy efficiency for 2030, 2) evaluate how to reduce electricity consumption, 3) amend the law accordingly to institute a mechanism for generating units of energy saved (Negawatts) in energy supply and demand, and to use electricity bills as a clearinghouse for repayment of loans, taking into consideration financial exposure of electricity providers. The decision also charges the Finance Minister in concentration with the Energy Minister to consider an update in tax policy regarding the deprecation for energy-saving products. Photovoltaic commercial facilities in particular will be granted a tax benefit in form of an accelerated depreciation at a 20 % rate over a three-year period.\\xa0 In terms of energy efficiency in buildings, the Plan urges the Energy Minister, the Environmental Protection Minister, the Construction and Housing Minister, and the Finance Minister to evaluate how to update the Energy Sources Law of 1989 to establish energy ratings for new residential buildings and offices based on Israeli Standard 5282. The Housing and Energy Ministers must explain how to achieve the emissions reduction target of of 5.9 M tCO2e by 2030 in the building sector, notably by 1) increase the number of new buildings built under the country's principal green building standard, SI 5281, and 2) assess technical means.\\xa0 Other measures in the Plan include a confirmation of the governmental efforts to achieve a 10 % target for electricity generation from renewables by 2020, in accordance with Government Decision 4450 of January 2009.\",\n",

Amendments to this Act are aimed at facilitating conditions for using the option to write-off receivables as a tax deductible expense for already established irrecoverable/junk loans through out of court resolution of write-offs. This would reduce the number of civil cases and speed up the process of decreasing the share of junk loans among total loans. In addition to existing measures related to write-offs of receivables which are focused on deleveraging citizens and entrepreneurs, and with regard to the perceived need to accelerate the process of deleveraging companies and decreasing the share of irrecoverable and junk loans, amendments to the Corporate Income Tax Act would prescribe provisions that would encourage the process of deleveraging entrepreneurs during 2017, whereby the write-off, without initiating judicial or enforcement proceedings or other proceedings under the Corporate income tax Act in terms of irrecoverable loans or junk loans of entrepreneurs, would be established as a tax deductible expense. Therefore, this measure would be introduced as a temporary measure, limited to a certain time period.',\n",

A simple tax would be charged to all persons who are currently obligated to pay utility charges. This means that taxpayers would be taxed for residential facilities, office spaces, garages, building plots used for business activities and unused building land. Potential tax exemptions will be regulated by law, i.e., local self-government units will not have the authority to independently exempt individuals or groups of users. Since the local units have not been collecting utility charges for construction zoned property (although the law provided them with this option), this means that a new one group of taxpayers will emerge in practice. This tax will be collected by local government or the Tax Administration in areas where local self-government units lack adequate capacity. With regard to the fact that the property tax will be considered a multi-purpose local tax, local self-government units will achieve additional flexibility when using tax revenue. On the basis of an up to date registration of taxable properties and based on the controlled application of tax exemptions and reliefs during the implementation of the \"simple\" property tax, we expect an increase of up to 15% in the revenue generated from existing utility charges, i.e., increased annual income by HRK 300 million.',\n",

       "            'action_description': \"The Bill authorises a stimulus package that supports new and existing renewable energy\\nand energy efficiency programmes. The bill supersedes the tax provisions of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act 2008 as well as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act 2008.\\n\\nThe Bill allocated USD16.8bn to energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes. It foresaw the extension of credit for electricity produced from renewable sources. The limitation on the issuance of new clean renewable energy bonds was increased by USD1.6bn. On completing the 2009 'National Electric Transmission Congestion Study', the Secretary of Energy shall include an analysis of renewable energy sources constrained by lack of adequate transmission capacity. The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to create the 'Temporary Programme for Rapid Deployment of Renewable Energy and Electric Power Transmission Projects' that includes incremental hydropower and cutting edge biofuel projects. No limitation shall be placed on funding for the purchase and installation of energy efficiency and renewable energy equipment and materials.\\n\\nUnder the Bill, USD2.7bn was destined to the Department of Energy's 'Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Programme', created without funding by the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007, to finance energy efficiency and conservation projects and programmes through the concession of grants to states, territories, local governments and Native American tribes. An additional USD1bn was allocated to state energy offices to support weatheri-sation of low-income homes. USD2bn in grants was made available to US-based advanced battery manufacturing facilities.\\n\\nUSD400m was allocated to state and local grant programmes supporting advanced vehicles, and over USD80bn was destined for clean energy research, development and deployment, USD50bn of which was to be granted for direct appropriation and USD30bn in the form of tax-based incentives. USD277m was granted to Energy Frontier Research Centres to develop cost-effective alternative energy technologies and USD6bn was allocated to the 'Innovative Technologies Loan Guarantee Programme', established by the Energy Policy Act, to accelerate the deployment of commercial clean energy technologies. USD2.5bn was given for discretionary clean energy research and development managed by the Department of Energy (DOE), including USD800m for next generation biofuels and USD400m for geo-thermal technologies, and support for several research projects. Grants over USD110m were given to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to advance wind energy technologies, building new energy efficient facilities and upgrading the Laboratory's Integrated Bio-refinery Research Facility.\\n\\nThe Bill also allocated USD500m to a grant programme supporting clean energy work-force training managed by the Department of Labor and USD100m to support more workforce training that is managed by the DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.\\n\\nThe DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will monitor performance in accordance with Risk Mitigation Plans (RMPs). For large grant programmes such as the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG), weatherisation assistance and State Energy Programmes (SEP), the DOE will provide assistance to national labs to help measure and verify results. Grant recipients must submit a plan of how they will use funds within 18 months and disburse funds within 36 months. The DOE will perform on-site monitoring annually in each state.\",\n",

       "            'text': 'The Energy Tax Act gives rates of energy and carbon tax on fuel as an amount per quantity of fuel (krona and öre per litre, cubic metre or kg depending on the type of fuel). With the exception of the energy taxes on electrical energy, the information given below on tax based on energy content describes the typical energy-content equivalent of these levels of taxation or changes in these levels. The energy and carbon taxes on fuels have risen by 1629 öre/kWh between 1995 and 2019, depending on the type of fuel. The taxes vary depending on the type of fuel and the purpose for which it is used. A reduced rate is applied to some uses, including consumption for industrial manufacturing processes. In addition to these reduced taxes, a full exemption from energy and carbon tax on fuel used in some specific industrial process, such as metallurgical processes, can be granted under the Energy Tax Act. However, there is no tax reduction on the fuel consumption of a household that uses oil for heating. Table 9 shows the changes in energy and carbon tax on fossil fuels and electricity between 2012 and 2019. The biggest change is the diesel tax reduction of 13 öre/kWh between 2018 and 2019. This was a result of the removal of the tax exemption for low-level biodiesel blends. When the reduction obligation was introduced, the energy and carbon taxes on petrol and diesel were reduced to reflect the content of fossil carbon in the fuel blend, and to avoid the effects on the petrol and diesel price which had been seen when the tax on their biofuel content was introduced.',\n",
